Out of these eighty four were in Arabic language, sixty four in Urdu \nlanguage, twenty one were in English language and one each in French and Hausa. \n\nA board of highly qualified scholars judged the manuscripts and announced the \nresults. The manuscript of Sheikh Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, Jamiah Salafiyah \nBanaras (India) author of the book in hand (Ar-Rahiq Al-Makhtoom) received first \nprize of SR: 50,000 (Fifty thousand Saudi Riyals) for its authentic and sound \ncollections of the narrations.

Maktaba \nDar-us-Salam also published this book in Arabic language. I wished to publish this \nbook in English language fcr the wider benefit of humanity. Sheikh \nSafi-ur-Rahman willingly agreed to the idea and consented to publish the English \ntranslation.

In view of this, a whole \nchapter is here introduced about the nature and development of Arab tribes \nprior to Islam as well as the circumstantial environment that enwrapped the \nProphet\u2019s mission. \n\nLocation of the Arabs: \n\nLinguistically, the word \u201cArab\u201d means deserts and waste barren land \nwell-nigh waterless and treeless. Ever since the dawn of history, the Arabian \nPeninsula and its people have been called as such. \n\nThe Arabian Peninsula is enclosed in the west by the Red Sea and Sinai, \nin the east by the Arabian Gulf, in the south by the Arabian Sea, which is an \nextension of the Indian Ocean, and in the north by old Syria and part of Iraq. \nThe area is estimated between a million and a million and a quarter square \nmiles. \n\nThanks to its geographical position, the peninsula has always maintained \ngreat importance.. Considering its internal setting, it is mostly deserts and \nsandy places, which has rendered it inaccessible to foreigners and invaders, \nand allowed its people complete liberty and independence through the ages, \ndespite the presence of two neighbouring great empires. \n\nIts external setting, on the other hand, caused it to be the centre of the old \nworld and provided it with sea and land links with most nations at the time. \nThanks to this strategic position the Arabian Peninsula had become the \ncentre for trade, culture, religion and art. \n\n\n\nArab Tribes: \n\nArab kinfolks have been divided according to lineage into three groups: \n\n1. Perishing Arabs: The ancient Arabs, of whose history little is known, \nand of whom were \u2018Ad, Tharndd, Tasam, Jadis, Emlaq, and others. \n\n2. Pure Arabs: Who originated from the progeny of Ya\u2018rub bin Yashjub \nbin Qahtan. They were also called Qahtanian Arabs. \n\n3. Arabized Arabs: Who originated from the progeny of Ishmael. They \nwere also called \u2018Adnanian Arabs. \n\nThe pure Arabs - the people of Qahtan - originally lived in Yemen and \ncomprised many tribes, two of which were very famous: \n\na. Himyar: The most famous of whose septs were Zaid Al-Jamhur, \nQuda\u2018a and Sakasic. \n\nb. K ah lan: The most famous of whose septs were Hamdan, Anmar, Tai\u2019, \nMudhhij, Kinda, Lakhm, Judham, Azd, Aws, Khazraj and the \ndescendants of Jafna\u2014the kings of old Syria. \n\nKahlan septs emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the \nArabian Peninsula prior to the Great Flood (Sail Al- 'Arim of Ma\u2019rib Dam), \ndue to the failure of trade under the Roman pressure and domain on both sea \nand land trade routes following Roman occupation of Egypt and Syria. \n\nNaturally enough, the competition between Kahlan and Himyar led to the \nevacuation of the first and the settlement of the second in Yemen. \n\nThe emigrating septs of Kahlan can be divided into four groups: \n\nl.Azd: Who, under the leadership of \u2018Imran bin \u2018Amr Muzaiqba\u2019, \nwandered in Yemen, sent pioneers and finally headed northwards. \nDetails of their emigration can be summed up as follows: \n\nTha\u2018labah bin \u2018Amr left his tribe Al-Azd for Hijaz and dwelt \nbetween Tha\u2018labiyah and Dhi Qar.

Having wanted to see his \nwife and son again, Abraham came to Makkah, after Ishmael\u2019s marriage, \nbut he didn\u2019t find him at home. He asked Ishmael\u2019s wife about her husband \nand how they were doing. She complained of poverty, so he asked her to tell \nIshmael to change his doorstep. Ishmael understood the message, divorced \nhis wife and got married to the daughter of Mudad bin\u2018Amr, chief of the \ntribe of Jurhum.!'! \n\nOnce more, Abraham came to see his son, but again didn\u2019t find him at \nhome. He asked his new wife the same previous question, to which she \nthanked AMh. Abraham asked her to tell Ishmael to keep his doorstep (i.e. \nto keep her as wife) and went back to Palestine. \n\nA third time, Abraham came to Makkah to find Ishmael sharpening an \narrow under a lofty tree near Zamzam. The meeting, after a very long \njourney of separation, was very touching for a father so affectionate and a so \ndutiful and righteous son. This time, father and son built Al-Ka\u2018bah and \nraised its pillars, and Abraham, in compliance with Allah\u2019s Commandment, \ncalled unto people to make pilgrimage to it. \n\nBy the grace of AllSh, Ishmael had twelve sons from the daughter of \nMudad, whose names were Nabet, Qidar, Edbael, Mebsham, Mishma\u2019, \nDuma, Micha, Hudud, Yetma, Yetour, Nafis and Qidman, and who \nultimately formed twelve tribes inhabiting Makkah and trading between \n\n\nPI Qalb Jazeerat Al-Arab, p. 230. \n\n\n- 19 -", "start_char_idx": 25703, "end_char_idx": 28866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5f063d7-142a-4f9e-99f8-13f344f85eb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5f063d7-142a-4f9e-99f8-13f344f85eb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45056ba9-ab7a-4f39-845a-3c62731e7380", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "af04780463e74c16a14ffdde9e1eb26b18c7616529eefb0ad15176aac231dece", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41dbd529-477d-4f67-974b-0f7729486949", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9408ce6c647331051c727eb90d88bc2fd93f203b71a2bb13b5ee866630f3086c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6c64d7f4b6d199c63a900dfc3b3c23ec0e71a76857731967af3ada261c6219c6", "text": "PI Qalb Jazeerat Al-Arab, p. 230. \n\n\n- 19 - \n\n\n\nYemen, geographical Syria and Egypt.

The crowned kings were only those \nof Yemen, Heerah and Ghassan. All other rulers of Arabia were non- \ncrowned. \n\nRulership in Yemen: \n\nThe folks of Sheba were one of the oldest nations of the pure Arabs, who \nlived in Yemen. Excavations at \u201cOr\u201d brought to light their existence twenty \nfive centuries B.C. Their civilization flourished, and their domain spread \neleven centuries B.C. \n\nIt is possible to divide their ages according to the following estimation: \n\n1. The centuries before 650 B.C., during which their kings were called \n\u201cMakrib Sheba\u201d. Their capital was \u201cSarwah\u201d, also known as \n\u201cKhriba\u201d, whose ruins lie in a spot, a day\u2019s walk from the western side \nof \u201cMa\u2019rib\u201d. During this period, they started building the \u201cDam of \nMa\u2019rib\u201d which had great importance in the history of Yemen. Sheba \nwas also said to have had so great a domain that they had colonies \ninside and outside Arabia. \n\n2. From 650 B.C. until 115 B.C. During this era, they gave up the name \n\u201cMakrib\u201d and assumed the designation of \u201cKings of Sheba\u201d. They \nalso made Ma\u2019rib their capital instead of Sarwah. The ruins of Ma\u2019rib \nlie at a distance of sixty miles east of San\u2018a. \n\n3. From 115 B.C. until 300 A.D.

Their trade failed to a very great extent, \nfirstly, because of the Nabetean domain over the north of Hijaz; \nsecondly, because of the Roman superiority over the naval trade \nroutes after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Syria and the north of \nHijaz; and thirdly, because of the inter-tribal warfare.

However, Ma'dikarib \nwas assassinated by an Abyssinian (Ethiopian) he used to have him around \nfor service and protection. The family of Dhu Yazin was thus deprived of \nroyalty forever. Kisra, the Persian king, appointed a Persian ruler over San\u2018a \nand thus made Yemen a Persian colony. Persian rulers maintained rulership \nof Yemen until Badhan, the last of them, embraced Islam in 638 A.D., thus \nterminating the Persian domain over Yemen. \n\nRulership in Heerah: \n\nEver since Korosh the Great (557-529 B.C.) united the Persians, they \nruled Iraq and its neighbourhood.

Ardashir had reckoned that it \nwas impossible for him to rule the Arabs directly and prevent them from \nattacking his borders unless he appointed as king one of them who enjoyed \nsupport and power of his tribe. He had also seen that he could make use of \nthem against the Byzantine kings who always used to harass him.

Presiding over An-Nadwa House meetings where consultations \nrelating to serious issues were conducted, and marriage contracts were \nannounced. \n\n2. The Standard: He monopolized in his hand issues relevant to war \nlaunching. \n\n3. Doorkeeping of Al-Ka\u2018bah: He was the only one eligible to open its \ngate, and was responsible for its service and protection. \n\n4. Providing water for the Pilgrims: This means that he used to fill basins \nsweetened by dates and raisins for the pilgrims to drink. \n\n5. Feeding Pilgrims: This means making food for pilgrims who could not \nafford it. Qusai even imposed on Quraish annual land tax, paid at the \nseason of pilgrimage, for food.Pl \n\nIt is noteworthy however that Qusai singled out \u2018Abd Manaf, a son of \nhis, for honour and prestige though he was not his elder son (\u2018Abd Ad-Dar \nwas), and entrusted him with such responsibilities as chairing of An-Nadwa \nHouse, the standard, the doorkeeping of Al-Ka\u2018bah, providing water and \nfood for pilgrims. Due to the fact that Qusai\u2019s deeds were regarded as \nunquestionable and his orders inviolable, his death gave no rise to conflicts \namong his sons, but it later did among his grand children, for no sooner than \n\u2018Abd Munaf had died, his sons began to have rows with their cousins \u2014 \nsons of \u2018Abd Ad-Dar, which would have given rise to dissension and \nfighting among the whole tribe of Quraish, had it not been for a peace treaty \nwhereby posts were reallocated so as to preserve feeding and providing \nwater for pilgrims for the sons of \u2018Abd Munaf; while An-Nadwa House, the \nflag and the doorkeeping of AI-Ka\u2018bah were maintained for the sons of \n\u2018Abd Ad-Dar.

Those tribes \ndwelling near Heerah were subordinate to the Arabian king of Heerah, while \nthose dwelling in the Syrian semi-desert were under domain of the Arabian \nGhassanide king, a sort of dependency that was in reality formal rather than \nactual. However, those living in the hinder deserts enjoyed full autonomy. \n\nThese tribes in fact had heads chosen by the whole tribe which was a \ndemi-govemment based on tribal solidarity and collective interests in \ndefence of land and property. \n\nHeads of tribes enjoyed dictatorial privileges similar to those of kings, \nand were rendered full obedience and subordination in both war and peace. \nRivalry among cousins for rulership, however, often drove them to outdo \n\nf'l Ibn Hisham, 1/129-179. \n\nPI Tareekh Ard Al-Qur\u2019an, 2/104-106. \n\n\n- 32 - \n\n\n\none another in entertaining guests, affecting generosity, wisdom and \nchivalry for the sole purpose of outranking their rivals, and gaining fame \namong people especially poets who were the official spokesmen at the time. \n\nHeads of tribes and masters had special claims to spoils of war such as \nthe quarter of the spoils, whatever he chose for himself, or found on his way \nback or even the remaining indivisible spoils. \n\nThe Political Situation: \n\nThe three Arab regions adjacent to foreigners suffered great weakness \nand inferiority. The people there were either masters or slaves, rulers or \nsubordinates. Masters, especially the foreigners, had claim to every \nadvantage; slaves had nothing but responsibilities to shoulder. In other \nwords, arbitrary autocratic rulership brought about encroachment on the \nrights of subordinates, ignorance, oppression, iniquity, injustice and \nhardship, and turning them into people groping in darkness and ignorance, \nviz., fertile land which rendered its fruits to the rulers and men of power to \nextravagantly dissipate on their pleasures and enjoyments, whims and \ndesires, tyranny and aggression. The tribes living near these regions were \nfluctuating between Syria and Iraq, whereas those living inside Arabia were \ndisunited and governed by tribal conflicts and racial and religious disputes. \n\nThey had neither a king to sustain their independence nor a supporter to \nseek advice from, or depend upon, in hardships. \n\nThe rulers of Hijaz, however, were greatly esteemed and respected by the \nArabs, and were considered as rulers and servants of the religious centre. \nRulership of Hijaz was, in fact, a mixture of secular and official precedence \nas well as religious leadership. They ruled among the Arabs in the name of \nreligious leadership and always monopolized the custodianship of the Holy \nSanctuary and its neighbourhood. They looked after the interests of \nAl-Ka\u2018bah visitors and were in charge of putting Abraham\u2019s code into \neffect. They even had such offices and departments like those of the \nparliaments of today. However, they were too weak to carry the heavy \nburden, as this evidently came to light during the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) \ninvasion. \n\n\n- 33 - \n\n\n\nReligions of the Arabs", "start_char_idx": 53106, "end_char_idx": 57213, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "955a2d70-3701-4cd5-9d25-85988de1f4df": {"__data__": {"id_": "955a2d70-3701-4cd5-9d25-85988de1f4df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d2615af-bcb4-43ed-995b-a87f692df7bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "256854b327ed7a918aa521ffa4e5792fe81837bf9dda05395fc911e123cbbcda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aac0d3a5-8aa6-4b63-904b-0869267f0ef0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf97beb97f64d8591bf47c43a30ade46674839162264dc1fb9483a7c3958f057", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2e566188e14e2436e4c905db409530404e82dcea7f242a12deb4dcda14baff15", "text": "- 33 - \n\n\n\nReligions of the Arabs \n\n\nMost of the Arabs had complied with the call of Ishmael f *ji , and \nprofessed the religion of his father Abraham f *-n \u00ab<i*.

However, they still \nmaintained such fundamental beliefs such as monotheism as well as various \nother aspects of Abraham\u2019s religion, until the time when a chief of Khuza\u2018a, \nnamely \u2018Amr bin Luhai, who was renowned for righteousness, charity, \nreverence and care for religion, and was granted unreserved love and \nobedience by his tribesmen, came back from a trip to Syria where he saw \npeople worship idols, a phenomenon he approved of and believed it to be \nrighteous since Syria was the locus of Messengers and Scriptures, he \nbrought with him an idol (Hubal) which he placed in the middle of \nAl-Ka\u2018bah and summoned people to worship it. Readily enough, paganism \nspread all over Makkah and, thence, to Hijaz, people of Makkah being \ncustodians of not only the Sacred House but the whole Haram as well.

Upon \npilgrimage time, the idols were distributed among the tribes to take back \nhome. PI Every tribe, and house, had their own idols, and the Sacred House \nwas also overcrowded with them.

Some features of their worship of \nidols were: \n\n1. Self-devotion to the idols, seeking refuge with them, acclamation of their \nnames, calling for their help in hardship, and supplication to them for \nfulfillment of wishes, hopefully that the idols (i.e., heathen gods) would \nmediate with Allah for the fulfillment of people\u2019s wishes. \n\n2.

Quraish, for example, \nout of arrogance, feeling of superiority to other tribes and pride in their \ncustodianship of the Sacred House, would refrain from going to \u2018Arafah \nwith the crowd, instead they would stop short at Muzdalifah.

They also, out of a \ndeeply-rooted misconception, denied pilgrims, other than Makkans, access \nto the food they had brought when they wanted to make pilgrimage or lesser \npilgrimage. \n\nThey ordered pilgrims coming from outside Makkah to circumambulate \nAl-Ka\u2018bah in Quraish uniform clothes, but if they could not afford them, \nmen were to do so in a state of nudity, and women with only some piece of \ncloth to hide their groins.

The \nsecond phase started with the Roman occupation of Palestine under the \nleadership of Roman Buts in 70 A.D. This resulted in a tidal wave of Jewish \nmigration into Hijaz, and Yathrib, Khaibar and Taima\u2019, in particular. Here, \nthey made proselytes of several tribes, built forts and castles, and lived in \nvillages. Judaism managed to play an important role in the pre-Islam \npolitical life.

With the advent of \nJudaism and Christianity, however, Sabianism began to give way to the new \nreligions, although it retained some followers mixed or adjacent to the \nMagians in Iraq and the Arabian GuIf.W \n\nThe Religious Situation: \n\nSuch was the religious life of the Arabians before the advent of Islam. \nThe role that the religions prevalent played was so marginal, in fact it was \nnext to nothing. The polytheists, who faked Abrahamism, were so far \ndetached from its precepts, and totally oblivious of its immanent good \nmanners. They plunged into disobedience and ungodliness, and developed \ncertain peculiar religious superstitions that managed to leave a serious \nimpact on the religious and socio-political life in the whole of Arabia. \n\nJudaism turned into abominable hypocrisy in league with hegemony. \nRabbis turned into lords to the exclusion of the Lord. They got involved in \nthe practice of dictatorial subjection of people and calling their subordinates \nto account for the least word or idea. Their sole target turned into \nacquisition of wealth and power even if it were at the risk of losing their \nreligion, or the emergence of atheism and disbelief. \n\nChristianity likewise opened its doors wide to polytheism, and got too \ndifficult to comprehend as a heavenly religion. As a religious practice, it \ndeveloped a sort of peculiar medley of man and God. It exercised no bearing \nwhatsoever on the souls of the Arabs who professed it simply because it was \nalien to their style of life and did not have the least relationship with their \npractical life. \n\nPeople of other religions were similar to the polytheists with respect to \ntheir inclinations, dogmas, customs and traditions. \n\n\nl |] Tareekh Ard Al-Qur\u2019in, 2/193-208. \n\n\n- 42 - \n\n\n\nAspects of Pre-Islamic \nArabian Society \n\nAfter the research we have made into the religious and political life of \nArabia, it is appropriate to speak briefly about the social, economic and \nethical conditions prevalent therein. \n\nSocial Life of the Arabs: \n\nThe Arabian Society presented a social medley, with different and \nheterogeneous social strata. The status of the woman among the nobility \nrecorded an advanced degree of esteem. The woman enjoyed a considerable \nportion of free will, and her decision would most often be enforced. She was \nso highly cherished that blood would be easily shed in defence of her \nhonour. In feet, she was the most decisive key to bloody fight or friendly \npeace. These privileges notwithstanding, the family system in Arabia was \nwholly patriarchal. The marriage contract rested completely in the hands of \nthe woman\u2019s legal guardian whose words with regard to her marital status \ncould never be questioned. \n\nOn die other hand, there were other social strata where prostitution and \nindecency were ram pant and in full operation. Abu Da\u2019ud, on the authority \n^of * Aishah w* uji ^ reported four kinds of marriage in pre-Islamic Arabia: \n''The first was similar to present-day marriage procedures, in which case a \nman gives his daughter in marriage to another man after a dowry has been \nagreed on. In the second, the husband would send his wife \u2014 after the \nmenstruation period \u2014 to cohabit with another man in order to conceive. \nAfter conception her husband would, if he desired, have a sexual intercourse \nwife her. A third kind was that a group of less than ten men would have \nsexual intercourse with a woman. If she conceived and gave birth to a child, \nshe would send for these men, and nobody could abstain. They would come \ntogether to her house. She would say: \u2018You know what you have done. I \nhave given birth to a child and it is your child\u2019 (pointing to one of them). \nThe man meant would have to accept. The fourth kind was that a lot of men \nwould have sexual intercourse with a certain woman (a whore). She would \nnot prevent anybody. Such women used to put a certain flag at their gates to \ninvite in anyone who liked.

The winners would \nfreely have sexual intercourse with such women, but disgrace would follow \nthe children conceived in this way all their lives. \n\nPre-Islam Arabs had no limited number of wives. They could marry two \nsisters at the same time, or even the wives of their fathers if divorced or \nwidowed. Divorce was to a very great extent in the power of the husband.* 2 ] \n\nThe obscenity of adultery prevailed almost among all social classes \nexcept few men and women whose self-dignity prevented them from \ncommitting such an act. Free women were in much better conditions than \nthe female slaves who constituted the greatest calamity. It seemed that the \ngreatest majority of pre-Islam Arabs did not feel ashamed of committing \nthis obscenity. Abu Da\u2019ud reported: A man stood up in front of Prophet \nMuhammad ^ ^ and said: \u201cO Prophet of Allah! that boy is my son.

Whilst some Arabs held children dear to their hearts and \ncherished them greatly, others buried their female children alive because an \n\n\n* ] ] Abu Da\u2019Od - The book of marriage. \nt 2 ) Abu Da\u2019Od - The bode of marriage. \n\n* 3 ] Abu Da\u2019ttd - Chapter \u201cThe child is to the one on whose bed it was bom.\u201d \n\n\n\nillusory fear of poverty and shame weighed heavily on them. The practice of \ninfanticide cannot, however, be seen as irrevocably rampant because of their \ndire need for male children to guard themselves against their enemies. \n\nAnother aspect of the Arabs\u2019 life which deserves mention is the \nbedouin\u2019s deep-seated emotional attachment to his clan. Family, or perhaps \ntribal-pride, was one of the strongest passions with him. The doctrine of \nunity of blood as the principle that bound the Arabs into a social unity was \nformed and supported by tribal-pride. Their undisputed motto was: \u201ciiul \nUjit* j! uu\u00bb \u2014 Support your brother whether he is an oppressor or oppressed\u201d \nin its literal meaning; they disregarded the Islamic amendment which states \nthat supporting an oppressor brother implies deterring him from \ntransgression. \n\nAvarice for leadership, and keen sense of emulation often resulted in \nbitter tribal warfare despite descendency from one common ancestor. In this \nregard, the continued bloody conflicts of Aws and Khazraj, \u2018Abs and \nDhubyan, Bakr and Taghlib, etc. are striking examples. \n\nInter-tribal relationships were fragile and weak due to continual inter\u00ac \ntribal wars of attrition. Deep devotion to religious superstitions and some \ncustoms held in veneration, however, used to curb their impetuous tendency \nto quench their thirst for blood. In other cases, there were the motives of, \nand respect for, alliance, loyalty and dependency which could successfully \nbring about a spirit of rapport, and abort groundless bases of dispute. A \ntime-honoured custom of suspending hostilities during the prohibited \nmonths (Muharram, Rajab, Dhul-Qa\u2018dah, and Dhul-Hijjah) functioned \nfavourably and provided an opportunity for them to earn their living and \ncoexist in peace. \n\nWe may sum up the social situation in Arabia by saying that the Arabs of \nthe pre-Islamic period were groping about in the dark and ignorance, \nentangled in a mesh of superstitions paralyzing their mind and driving them \nto lead an animal-like life. The woman was a marketable commodity and \nregarded as a piece of inanimate property. Inter-tribal relationships were \nfragile. Avarice for wealth and involvement in futile wars were the main \nobjectives that governed their chiefs\u2019 self-centred policies. \n\n\n- 45 -", "start_char_idx": 76932, "end_char_idx": 81201, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c532864b-98dc-42d3-8042-5e5ccd76cfc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c532864b-98dc-42d3-8042-5e5ccd76cfc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "62dcee33-0fce-434a-8721-05201f3d1f79", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "015ea8a6de16c230f729f97848f745f7da0fcb28f9d66ae33efd86c07e3a265e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c607705b-b3d1-474d-8a9d-f4f0ed463ced", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59d6434015cc1828b5ed7ef7777fba323fc5f72f04850adf814699f8d672c290", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6dc2ed2456c001bc7861297284f092b1475121b9ec38222aaebb29f1ed5bcc52", "text": "- 45 - \n\n\n\nEconomic Situation: \n\nThe economic situation ran in line with the social atmosphere. The \nArabian ways of living would illustrate this phenomenon quite clearly. \nTrade was the most common means of providing their needs of life. The \ntrade journeys could not be fulfilled unless security of caravan routes and \ninter-tribal peaceful co-existence were provided - two imperative exigencies \nunfortunately lacking in Arabia except during the prohibited months within \nwhich the Arabs held their assemblies of \u2018Ukaz, Dhil-Majaz, Mijannah and \nothers. \n\nIndustry was alien to the Arabian psychology. Most of available \nindustries of knitting and tannage in Arabia were done by people coming \nfrom Yemen, Heerah and the borders of Syria. Inside Arabia there was some \nsort of farming and stock-breeding. Almost all the Arabian women worked \nin yam spinning but even this practice was continually threatened by wars. \nOn the whole, poverty, hunger and insufficient clothing were the prevailing \nfeatures in Arabia, economically. \n\nEthics: \n\nWe cannot deny that the pre-Islam Arabs had such a large bulk of evils. \nAdmittedly, vices and evils, utterly rejected by reason, were rampant \namongst the pre-Islam Arabs, but this could never screen off the surprise- \nprovoking existence of highly praiseworthy virtues, of which we could \nadduce the following: \n\n1. Hospitality: They used to emulate one another at hospitality and take \nutmost pride in it. Almost half of their poetry heritage was dedicated to \nthe merits and nobility attached to entertaining one\u2019s guest. They were \ngenerous and hospitable on the point of fault. They would sacrifice their \nprivate sustenance to a cold or hungry guest. They would not hesitate to \nincur heavy blood-money and relevant burdens just to stop blood-shed, \nand consequently merit praise and eulogy. \n\nIn the context of hospitality, there springs up their common habits of \ndrinking wine which was regarded as a channel branching out of \ngenerosity and showing hospitality. Wine drinking was a genuine source \nof pride for the Arabs of the pre-Islamic period. The great poets of tha t \nera never forgot to include their suspending odes the most ornate lines \n\n\n- 46 - \n\n\n\npregnant with boasting and praise of drinking orgies. Even the word \n\u2018grapes\u2019 in Arabic is identical to generosity in both pronunciation and \nspelling. Gambling was also another practice of theirs closely associated \nwith generosity since the proceeds would always go to charity. Even the \nNoble Qur\u2019an does not play down the benefits that derive from wine \ndrinking and gambling, but also says, \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the sin of them is greater than their benefit.\u201d [2:219] \n\n2. Keeping a covenant: For the Arab, to make a promise was to run into \ndebt. He would never grudge the death of his children or destruction of \nhis household just to uphold the deep-rooted tradition of covenant\u00ac \nkeeping. The literature of that period is rich in stories highlighting this \nmerit. \n\n3. Sense of honour and repudiation of injustice: This attribute stemmed \nmainly from excess courage, keen sense of self-esteem and impetuosity. \nThe Arab was always in revolt against the least allusion to humiliation or \nslackness. He would never hesitate to sacrifice himself to maintain his \never alert sense of self-respect. \n\n4. Firm will and determination: An Arab would never desist an avenue \nconducive to an object of pride or a standing of honour, even if it were at \nthe expense of his life. \n\n5. Forbearance, perseverance and mildness: The Arab regarded these \ntraits with great admiration, no wonder, his impetuosity and courage- \nbased life was sadly wanting in them. \n\n6.

Let us now speak a \nlittle about Hashim and his descendants: \n\n1. Hashim: As we have previously mentioned, he was the one responsible \nfor giving food and water to the pilgrims. This had been his charge when \nthe sons of \u2018Abd Munaf and those of \u2018Abd Ad-Dar compromised on \ndividing the charges between them. Hashim was wealthy and honest. He \nwas the first to offer the pilgrims sopped bread in broth. His first name \nwas \u2018Amr but he was called Hashim because he had been in the practice \nof crumbling bread (for the pilgrims). He was also the first man who \nstarted Quraish\u2019s two journeys of summer and winter. It was reported \nthat he went to Syria as a merchant. In Madinah, he married Salma \u2014 the \ndaughter of \u2018Amr from Bani \u2018Adi bin An-Najjar. He spent some time \nwith her in Madinah then he left for Syria again while she was pregnant. \nHe died in Ghazza in Palestine in 497 A.D. Later, his wife gave birth to \n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib and named him Shaiba for the white hair in his head! 1 ), \nand brought him up in her father\u2019s house in Madinah. None of his family \nin Makkah learned of his birth. Hashim had four sons; Asad, Abu Saifi, \nNadia and \u2018Abdul-Muttalib, and five daughters Ash-Shifa, Khalida, \nDa\u2018ifa, Ruqyah and Jannah.Pl \n\n2. \u2018Abdul-Muttalib: We have already known that after the death of \nHashim, the charge of pilgrims\u2019 food and water went to his brother \nAl-Muttalib bin \u2018Abd Munaf (who was honest, generous and \ntrustworthy). When \u2018Abdul-Muttalib reached the age of boyhood, his \nuncle Al-Muttalib heard of him and went to Madinah to fetch him. When \nhe saw him, tears filled his eyes and rolled down his cheeks, he embraced \nhim and took him on his camel. The boy, however abstained from going \nwith him to Makkah until he took his mother\u2019s consent. Al-Muttalib \nasked her to send the boy with him to Makkah, but she refused. He \nmanaged to convince her saying: \u201cYour son is going to Makkah to \nrestore his father\u2019s authority, and to live in the vicinity of the Sacred \n\n\nPI Ibn His ham 1/137; Rahmat-ul-liTalameen, 1/26,2/24. \nPI Ibn Hisham, 1/107. \n\n\n- 50 -", "start_char_idx": 87828, "end_char_idx": 90270, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9c67d1e-d964-4f8a-a03f-510dfca2711f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9c67d1e-d964-4f8a-a03f-510dfca2711f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9caf0225-414d-4533-a300-ba29b584d6d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "98580c54088badbceb0186716ffb58d8f1f98e154042b0cf2050f733ac4a0b77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d11edd7a-09b0-4c7b-b1c2-474f5a230c8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2df8b0a6ae2ccd42aaa4debba5425768bc7c609023cdaffbc434646664751c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b29b4f803e31e4a76fd5c22ce57603186cfd7a7a52a4832839a610fc954f4563", "text": "PI Ibn His ham 1/137; Rahmat-ul-liTalameen, 1/26,2/24. \nPI Ibn Hisham, 1/107. \n\n\n- 50 - \n\n\n\nHouse.\u201d There in M akkah, people wondered at seeing Abdul-Muttalib, \nand they considered him the slave of Muttalib.

Consequently, he wrote \nto his uncles of Bani An-Najjar (his mother\u2019s brothers) to come to his \naid. His uncle, Abu Sa\u2018d bin \u2018Adi (his mother\u2019s brother) marched to \nMakkah at the head of eighty horsemen and camped in Abtah in Makkah. \n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib received the men and invited them to go to his house but \nAbu Sa\u2018d said: \u201cNot before I meet Nawfal.\u201d He found Nawfal sitting \nwith some old men of Quraish in the shade of Al-Ka\u2018bah. Abu Sa\u2018d drew \nhis sword and said: \u201cI swear by Allah that if you don\u2019t restore to my \nnephew what you have taken, I will kill you with this sword.\u201d Nawfal \nwas thus forced to give up what he had usurped, and the notables of \nQuraish were made to witness to his words. Abu Sa\u2018d then went to \n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib\u2019s house where he stayed for three nights, made \u2018Umra \nand left back for Madinah. Later on, Nawfal entered into alliance with \nBani \u2018Abd Shams bin \u2018Abd Munaf against Bani Hashim. When Khuza'a, \na tribe, saw Bani An-Najjar\u2019s support to \u2018Abdul-Muttalib they said: \u201cHe \nis our son as he is yours.

They went into An-Nadwa \nHouse and entered into alliance with Bani Hashim against Bani \u2018Abd \nShams and Nawfal.

He found the swords, armours and the two deer of gold. The \ngate of Al-Ka\u2018bah was stamped from the gold swords and the two deer \nand then the tradition of providing Zamzam water to pilgrims was \nestablished. \n\nWhen the well of Zamzam gushed water forth, Quraish made a claim \nto partnership in the enterprise, but \u2018Abdul-Muttalib refused their \ndemands on grounds that Allah had singled only him out for this \nhonourable job. To settle the dispute, they agreed to consult Bani Sa'd\u2019s \ndiviner. On their way, Allah showed them His Signs that confirmed \n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib\u2019s prerogative as regards the sacred spring. Only then did \n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib make a solemn vow to sacrifice one of his adult children \nto Al-Ka\u2018bah if he had ten. \n\nThe second event was that of Abraha As-Sabah Al-Habashi, the \nAbyssinian (Ethiopian) viceroy in Yemen. He had seen that the Arabs \nmade their pilgrimage to Al-Ka\u2018bah so he built a large church in San\u2018a in \norder to attract the Arab pilgrims to it to the exclusion of Makkah. A man \nfrom Kinana tribe understood this move, therefore he entered the church \nstealthily at night and besmeared its front wall with excrement. When \nAbraha knew of that, he got very angry and led a great army-of sixty \nthousand warriors - to demolish Al-Ka\u2018bah. He chose the biggest \nelephant for himself. His army included nine or thirteen elephants. He \ncontinued marching until he reached a place called Al-Magmas. There, \nhe mobilized his army, prepared his elephants and got ready to enter \nMakkah. When he reached Muhassar Valley, between Muzdalifah and \nMina, the elephant knelt down and refused to go forward. Whenever they \ndirected it northwards, southwards or eastwards, the elephant moved \nquickly but when directed westwards towards Al-Ka\u2018bah, it knelt down. \nMeanwhile, Allah loosed upon them birds in flights, hurling against them \nstones of baked clay and made them like green blades devoured.

It was a \ngift from Allah to His Prophet and his family. It could actually be \nregarded as a Divine auspicious precursor of the light to come and \naccompany the advent of the Prophet and his family. By contrast, \nJerusalem had suffered under the yoke of the atrocities of Allah\u2019s \nenemies. Here we can recall Bukhtanassar in B.C. 587 and the Romans in \n70 A.D.

Abyssinia (Ethiopia) maintained strong ties with the \nRomans, while the Persians on the other hand, were on the vigil with \nrespect to any strategic changes that were looming on the socio-political \nhorizon, and soon came to occupy Yemen. Incidentally, the Roman and \nPersian Empires stood for the powerful civilized world at that time. The \nElephant Raid Event riveted file world\u2019s attention to the sacredness of \nAllSh\u2019s House, and showed that this House had been chosen by Allah for \nits holiness. It followed then if any of its people claimed Prophethood, it \nwould be congruous with the outcome of the Elephant Event, and would \nprovide a justifiable explanation for the ulterior Divine Wisdom that lay \nbehind backing polytheists against Christians in a manner that \ntranscended the cause-and-effect formula. \n\n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib had ten sons, Al-Harith, Az-Zubair, Abu Talib, \n\u2018Abdullah, Hamzah, Abu Lahab, Ghidaq, Maqwam, Safar and \nAl-\u2018 Abbas.

He was also the son whom the \ndivination arrows pointed at to bd slaughtered as a sacrifice to \nAl-Ka\u2018bah. When \u2018Abdul-Muttalib had ten sons and they reached \nmaturity, he divulged to them his secret vow in which they silently and \nobediently acquiesced. Their names were written on divination arrows \nand given to the guardian of their most beloved goddess, Hubal. The \narrows were shuffled and drawn. An arrow showed that it was \u2018Abdullah \nto be sacrificed. \u2018Abdul-Muttalib then took the boy to Al-Ka\u2018bah with a \nrazor to slaughter the boy. Quraish, his uncles from Makhzum tribe and \nhis brother Abu Talib, however, tried to dissuade him from \nconsummating his purpose. He then sought their advice as regards his \nvow. They suggested that he summon a she-diviner to judge whereabout. \nShe ordered that the divination arrows should be drawn with respect to \n\u2018Abdullah as well as ten camels. She added that drawing the lots should \nbe repeated with ten more camels every time the arrow showed \n\u2018Abdullah. The operation was thus repeated until the number of the \ncamels amounted to one hundred. At this point the arrow showed the \ncamels, consequently they were all slaughtered (to the satisfaction of \nHubal) instead of his son.

He put him \nwith his children and preferred him to them. He singled the boy out with \ngreat respect and high esteem. Abu Talib remained for forty years \ncherishing his nephew and extending all possible protection and support to \nhim. His relations with the others were determined in the light of the \ntreatment they showed to the Prophet ^ \u00abvi j*. \n\nIbn \u2018Asakir reported on the authority of Jalhamah bin\u2018Arfuta who said: \n\u201cI came to Makkah when it was a rainless year, so Quraish said \u2018O Abu \nTalib, the valley has become leafless and the children hungry, let us go and \npray for rain-fall.\u2019 Abu Talib went to Al-Ka\u2018bah with a young boy who was \nas beautiful as the sun, and a black cloud was over his head.

It was \nalso exposed to the wearing factors of nature \u2014 because it was built a long \ntime ago \u2014 that weakened and cracked its walls. Five years before \nProphethood, there was a great flood in Makkah that swept towards \nAl-Ka\u2018bah and almost demolished it. Quraish was obliged to rebuild it to \nsafeguard its holiness and position. The chiefs of Quraish decided to use \nonly licit money in rebuilding Al-Ka\u2018bah, so all money that derived from \nharlotry, usury or unjust practices was excluded. They were, at first, too \nawed to knock down the wall, but Al-Waleed bin Al-Mugheerah \nAl-M ukhzumi started the work. Seeing that no harm had happened to him, \nthe others participated in demolishing the walls until they reached the basis \nlaid by Abraham. When they started rebuilding its walls, they divided the \nwork among the tribes. Each tribe was responsible for rebuilding a part of it. \nThe tribes collected stones and started work. The man who laid the stones \nwas a Roman mason called Baqum. The work went on in harmony till the \ntime came to put the sacred Black Stone in its proper place.

When the structure was fifteen yards \nhigh they erected the roof which rested on six columns. \n\nWhen the building ofAl-Ka\u2018bah had finished, it assumed a square form \nfifteen metres high. The side with the Black Stone and the one opposite \nwere ten metres long each. The Black Stone was 1.50 metre from the \ncircumambulation level ground. The two other sides were twelve metres \nlong each. The door was two metres high from the level ground.

He shunned superstitious practices but took an active part \nin constructive and useful dealings, otherwise, he would have recourse to \nhis self-consecrated solitude. He kept himself aloof from drinking wine, \neating meat slaughtered on stone altars, or attending idolatrous festivals. He \nheld the idols in extreme aversion and most abhorrence. He could never \ntolerate someone swearing by Al-Lat and Al-\u2018Uzza. Allah\u2019s providence, no \ndoubts, detached him from all abominable or evil practices. Even when he \ntried to obey his instinct to enjoy some life pleasures or follow some \nirrespectable traditions, Allah\u2019s providence intervened to curb any lapse in \nthis course.

This meditative temperament helped to \nwiden the mental gap between him and his compatriots. He used to provide \nhimself with Sawiq (barley porridge) and water and then directly head for \nthe hills and ravines in the neighbourhood of Makkah. One of these in \nparticular was his favourite resort \u2014 a cave named Hira\u2019, in the Mount \nAn-Nour. It was only two miles from Makkah, a small cave 4 yards long \nand 1.75 yard wide. He would always go there and invite wayfarers to share \nhim his modest provision. He used to devote most of his time, and Ramadan \nin particular, to worship and meditation on the universe around him. His \nheart was restless about the moral evils and idolatry that were rampant \namong his people; he was as yet helpless because no definite course, or \nspecific approach had been available for him to follow and rectify the ill \npractices around him. This solitude attended with this sort of contemplative \napproach must be understood in its Divine perspective. It was a preliminary \nstage to the period of grave responsibilities that he was to shoulder very soon.1'1 \n\nPrivacy and detachment from the impurities of life were two \nindispensable prerequisites for the Prophet\u2019s soul to come into close \ncommunion with the Unseen Power that lies behind all aspects of existence \nin this infinite universe.

Ibn Al-Qayyim, mentioning the stages of the \nRevelation, said: \n\nThe First: The period of true vision. It was the starting point of the \n\nRevelation to the Messenger of Allah fU, uii \n\n\nt'lSahih Al-Bukhari, The book of Tafeeer, 2/733. \n\n\n- 71 - \n\n\n\nThe Second: What the angel invisibly cast in the Prophet\u2019s mind and \nheart. The Messenger of AllSh ^ uii ^ said: \u201cThe Noble Spirit \nrevealed to me \u2018No soul will perish until it exhausts its due course, so \nfear Allah and gently request Him. Never get so impatient to the verge \nof disobedience of Alldh. What Allah has can never be acquired but \nthrough obedience to Him.\u2019\u201d \n\nThe Third: The angel used to visit the Messenger of Allah ^<><111,/. \nin the form of a human being and would speak to him directly. This \nwould enable him to fully understand what the angel said.

And be patient for the \nsake of your Lord (i.e. perform your duty to Allah)!\u201d [74:1-7] \n\n\n\nFor convenience and ease of understanding, we are going to segment the \nMessage into its immediate constituents: \n\n\nl.The ultimate objective of warning is to make sure that no one \nbreaching the pleasures of Allah in the whole universe is ignorant \nof the serious consequences that his behaviour entails, and to create \na sort of unprecedented shock within his mind and heart. \n\n\n2. \u2018Magnifying the Lord\u2019 dictates explicitly that the only pride \nallowed to nourish on the earth is exclusively Allah\u2019s to the \nexclusion of all the others\u2019. \n\n\n3. \u2018Cleansing the garments and shunning all aspects of abomination\u2019 \npoint directly to the indispensable need to render both the exterior \nand interior exceptionally chaste and pure, in addition to the \nprerequisite of sanctifying the soul and establishing it highly \nimmune against the different sorts of impurities and the various \nkinds of pollutants. Only through this avenue can the soul of the \nProphet r L 0 v,u\u00abjii >r u reach an ideal status and become eligible to \nenjoy the shady mercy of Allah and His protection, security, \nguidance and ever-shining light; and will consequently set the \nhighest example to the human community, attract the sound hearts \nand inspire awe and reverence in the stray ones in such a manner \n\n\n- 73 - \n\n\n\nthat all the world, in agreement or disagreement, will head for it \nand take it as the rock-bed in all facets of their welfare. \n\n4. The Prophet \u00abjii ^jl, must not regard his strife in the way of \n\nAllah as a deed of grace that entitles him to a great reward. On the \ncontrary, he has to exert himself to the utmost, dedicate his whole \nefforts and be ready to offer all sacrifices in a spirit of self- \nforgetfulness enveloped by an ever-present awareness of Allah, \nwithout the least sense of pride in his deeds or sacrifices. \n\n5. The last verse of the Qur\u2019an revealed to the Prophet \n\nalludes to the hostile attitude of the obdurate disbelievers, who will \njeer at him and his followers. They are expected to disparage him \nand step up their malice to the point of scheming against his life \nand lives of all the believers around him. In this case he has got to \nbe patient and is supposed to persevere and display the highest \ndegree of stamina for the sole purpose of attaining the pleasure of \n\nAllah. \n\nThese were the basic preliminaries that the Prophet had to \n\nobserve, very simple injunctions in appearance, greatly fascinating in their \ncalm rhythm, but highly effective in practice. They constituted the trigger \nthat aroused a far-ranging tempest in all the comers of the world. \n\nThe verses comprise the constituents of the new call and propagation of \nthe new faith. A warning logically implies that there are malpractices with \npainful consequences to be sustained by the perpetrators, and since the \npresent life is not necessarily the only room to bring people to account for \ntheir misdeeds or some of them, then the warning would necessarily imply \ncalling people to account on another day, i.e. die Day of Resurrection, and \nthis per se suggests the existence of a life other than this one we are living. \nAll die verses of the Noble Qur\u2019an call people to testify explicitly to the \nOneness of Allah, to delegate all their affairs to AllSh, the All-High, and to \nsubordinate the desires of the self and the desires of Allah\u2019s servants to the \nattainment of His Pleasures. \n\nThe constituents of the call to Islam could, briefly speaking, go as \nfollows: \n\nA. Testimony to the Oneness of All&h. \n\nB. Belief in the Hereafter. \n\nC. Sanctifying one\u2019s soul and elevating it high above evils and \nabominations that conduce to terrible consequences, besides this. \n\n\n- 74 -", "start_char_idx": 137669, "end_char_idx": 141720, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "974c1e9f-a669-4369-87bd-289e4dcb7970": {"__data__": {"id_": "974c1e9f-a669-4369-87bd-289e4dcb7970", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "87154e5b-dbde-48f5-b64e-0cb22c139115", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "7472b321a78b3bc563cfa6d803e3244b23111c9b2369170e0d1df056e9005969", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f237de23-0caf-4633-a0f3-79c47d121b52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5896d020e3390e5f9945b0e6abeae04881ca3a2f130890616a1c7a28ddda60a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3e7e534c1ad54efd96e9e5a6c5b0bbe11beeca534e552007d2411d5369981a7c", "text": "- 74 - \n\n\n\nthere is the dire need for virtues and perfect manners coupled with \nhabituating oneself to righteous deeds. \n\nD.

In order to attach a \nserious and earnest stamp to their demand, they chose to touch the most \nsensitive area in Arabian life, viz., ancestral pride.

Quraish knew that the Arab delegates were \ncoming wi thin a short time. They agreed that it was necessary to \ncontemplate a device that was bound to alienate the Arab pilgrims from the \nnew faith preached by Muhammad ^,<^< 111 ^. They went to see Al-Waleed \nbin Al-Mugheerah to deliberate on this issue. Al-Waleed invited them to \n\n\n(\u2018Jlbn Hisham, 1/265. \n\n\n- 85 - \n\n\n\nagree on a unanimous resolution that could enjoy the approbation of them \nall. However, they were at variance. Some suggested that they describe him \nas Kahin, i.e., soothsayer; but this suggestion was turned down on grounds \nthat his words were not so rhymed. Others proposed Majnun, i.e., possessed \nby jinn; this was also rejected because no insinuations peculiar to that state \nof mind were detected, they claimed. \u201cWhy not say he is a poet?\u201d Some \nsaid. Here again they could not reach a common consent, alleging that his \nwords were totally outside the lexicon of poetry. \u201cOK then; let us accuse \nhim of practising witchcraft,\u201d was a fourth suggestion. Here also Al-Waleed \nshowed some reluctance saying that the Prophet (L*, an was known to \nhave never involved himself in the practice of blowing on the knots, and \nadmitted that his speech was sweet tasting root and branch. He, however, \nfound that the most plausible charge to be levelled against Muhammad \nft -., <jji was witchcraft.

I \nswear by Allah he is not anyone of those. He is not interested in blowing \non knots as magicians are, nor do his words belong to the world of \nsoothsaying; he is not a poet either, for his mentality is not that of a \nrambler, nor is he insane because he has never been witnessed to develop \nany sort of hallucinations or insinuations peculiar to madmen. O people \nof Quraish, it is really a serious issue and I recommend that you \nreconsider your attitude.\u201d \n\nIt is narrated that An-Nadr, at a later stage, headed for Heerah where \nhe got conversant with the traditions of the kings of Persia and the \naccounts of people like Rustum and Asphandiar, and then returned to \nMakkah. Here he would always shadow the Messenger\u2019s steps in \nwhatever audiences the later held to preach the new faith and to caution \n\n\n- 90 - \n\n\n\npeople against Allah\u2019s wrath. An-Nadr would directly follow the Prophet \n(jLj .uu ail jU and narrate to the same audience long tales about those people \nof Persia.

If the matters were so \nwith the Prophet ^ what about those people deemed weak with no \n\nclan to support them? Let us consider their situation in some detail. \nWhenever Abu Jahl heard of the conversion of a man of high birth with \npowerful friends, he would degrade his prudence and intellect, undermine \nhis judgement; and threaten him with dire consequences if he was a \nmerchant. If the new convert was socially weak, he would beat him \nruthlessly and put him to unspeakable tortures.Pl \n\nThe uncle of \u2018Uthman bin \u2018Affan used to wrap \u2018Uthman in a mat of palm \nleaves, and set fire under him. When Umm Mus\u2018ab bin \u2018Umair heard of her \nson\u2019s conversion, she put him to starvation and then expelled him from her \nhouse. He used to enjoy full luxurious easy life, but in the aftermath of the \ntortures he sustained, his skin got wizened, and he assumed a horrible \nphysical appearance.Pl \n\nBilal, the slave of Omaiyah bin Khalaf, was severely beaten by his \nmaster when the latter came to know of his conversion to Islam. Sometimes \na rope was put around his neck and street boys were made to drag him \nthrough the streets and even across the hillocks of Makkah. At times he was \nsubjected to prolonged deprivation of food and drink; at others he was \nbound up, made to lie down on the burning sand and under the crushing \nburden of heavy stones. Similar other measures were resorted to in order to \nforce him to recant. All this proved in vain. He persisted in his belief in the \n\n\nPlFi Zilal Al-Qur\u2019an, 29/312; Sahih Muslim. \n\n\nPlRahmat-ul-lil\u2018alameen, 1/57; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl-al-Athar, p. 60. \n\n\n- 96 -", "start_char_idx": 178874, "end_char_idx": 182606, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3ccedc9-3cd2-48a8-a9ad-f19d01b88e26": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3ccedc9-3cd2-48a8-a9ad-f19d01b88e26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f875c8d9-f24e-4f12-8f40-8a5cfeb33dab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "60d95d528a4ae38dd6a7fe0ae96a509f42f9e682886b993c3eb8224a9d4e741e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d9246b9-ee2e-436d-b924-edffea6fc31b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1bcd0aff224116e6defa5fbbe52f4c1adaba4bfdea4e98bcf6d5d9e642ba43c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ededcbc31f6bf170c3a7c41c96bfbe0d29deaf74c38eab2eecd7cb209b0d4ae8", "text": "PlFi Zilal Al-Qur\u2019an, 29/312; Sahih Muslim. \n\n\nPlRahmat-ul-lil\u2018alameen, 1/57; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl-al-Athar, p. 60. \n\n\n- 96 - \n\n\n\nOneness of Allah.

The Prophet ^ \u00abw was greatly moved by the atrocities \nwhich were being perpetrated upon \u2018Ammar and his family. He always \ncomforted them and raised his hand in prayer and said: \u201cBe patient, you will \nverily find your abode in the Paradise.\u201d Yasir, the father, died because of \nrepeated tortures.

He took the decision to meet them secretly lest Quraish \nshould get to know of his designs, and so take measures that might foil his \ngoals. He also had in mind to avoid any sort of open confrontation with the \npolytheists because such a thing at this early stage would not be in the \ninterest of the newly-born Call, still vulnerable and not fully fledged. Once, \nin the fourth year of Prophethood, the Muslims were on their way to the \nhillocks of Makkah to hold a clandestine meeting with the Prophet ^ *ui \nwhen a group of polytheists did observe their suspicious movement and \nbegan to abuse and fight them. Sa\u2018d bin Abi Waqqas beat a polytheist and \nshed his blood and thus recorded the first instance of bloodshed in the \nhistory of Islam.PI \n\nThe Prophet <111 ^u, on the other hand, used to proclaim the Islamic \n\nFaith and preach it openly with deep devotion and studious pursuit, but for \nthe general welfare of the new converts and in consideration of the strategic \ninterest of Islam, he took Dar Al-Arqam, in As-Safa mountain, in the fifth \nyear of his mission, as a temporary centre \u2018o meet his followers secretly and \ninstruct them in the Qur\u2019an and in the Islamic wisdom. \n\n\nt'lTalqeeh Fuhoom Ahl-al-Athar, p. $0; Rahmat-ul-lil\u2018alameen, 1/57. \n! 2 )lbn Hisham, 1/319. \n\nP)lbn Hisham, 1/263. \n\n\n- 98 - \n\n\n\nThe First Migration to Abyssinia (Ethiopia): \n\n\nThe series of persecutions started late in the fourth year of Prophethood, \nslowly at first, but steadily accelerated and worsened day by day and month \nby month until the situation got so extremely grave and no longer tolerable \nin the middle of the fifth year, that the Muslims began to seriously think of \nfeasible ways liable to avert the painful tortures meted out to them. It was at \nthat gloomy and desperate time that Surah Al-Kahf (Chapter 18 \u2014 The \nCave) was revealed comprising definite answers to the questions with which \nthe polytheists of Makkah constantly pestered the Prophet ^ <*i\u00ab \u00abui . It \ncomprises three stories that include highly suggestive parables for the true \nbelievers to assimilate.

Future \ncircumstances of life are not necessarily the products of the prevalent \nconditions, they might be categorically the opposite. In other words, the war \nwaged against the Muslims would in the future assume a different turn, and \nthe tyrannous oppressors would one day come to suffer and be subjected to \nthe same tortures to which the Muslims were then put. Furthermore, there is \nthe story of Dhul-Qamain (The Two Homed One), the powerful ruler of \nwest and east. This story says explicitly that AMh takes His righteous \nservants to inherit the earth and whatever in it. It also speaks that Allah \nraises a righteous man every now and then to protect the weak against the \nstrong. \n\n\n- 99 - \n\n\n\nSurah Az-Zumar (Chapter 39 \u2014 The Crowds) was then revealed pointing \ndirectly to migration and stating that the earth is spacious enough and the \nbelievers must not consider themselves constrained by the forces of tyr ann y \nand evil: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood is (the reward) for those who do good in this world, and \nAlllh\u2019s earth is spacious (so if you cannot worship Allah at a \nplace, then go to another)! Only those who are patient shall \nreceive their rewjards in full without reckoning.\u201d [39:10]. \n\n\nThe Prophet ^ \u00abl\u00bb <ui had already known that Ashamah Negus, king of \nAbyssinia (Ethiopia), was a fair ruler who would not wrong any of his \nsubordinates, so he permitted some of his followers to seek asylum there in \nAbyssinia (Ethiopia). \n\n\nIn Rajab of the fifth year of Prophethood, a group of twelve men and four \nwomen left for Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Among the emigrants were \u2018Uthman \nbin \u2018AfFan and his wife Ruqaiyah (the daughter of the Prophet ^ <jui \n\nWith respect to these two emigrants, the Prophet \u00ab<u <m said: \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are the first people to migrate in the cause of Allah after \nAbraham and Lot f %ji l*u.\u201d \n\nThey sneaked out of Makkah under the heavy curtain of a dark night and \nheaded for the sea where two boats happened to be sailing for Abyssinia \n(Ethiopia), their destination. News of their intended departure reached the \nears of Quraish, so some men were despatched in their pursuit, but the \nbelievers had already left Shuaibah Port towards their secure haven where \nthey were received warmly and accorded due hospitality. \n\nIn Ramadan of the same year, the Prophet ,j-, \u00ab<i* an went into the Holy \nSanctuary where there was a large host of Quraish polytheists, including \nsome notables and celebrities. Suddenly he began reciting Surah An-Najm \n(Chapter 41 \u2014 The Star). The awe-inspiring Words of Allah descended \n\n\n- 100 - \n\n\n\nunawares upon them and they immediately got stunned by them. It was the \nfirst time for them to be shocked by the truthful Revelation. It had formerly \nbeen the favourite trick of those people who wished to dishonour \nRevelation, not only not to listen to it themselves but also to talk loudly and \ninsolently when it was being read, so that even the true listeners may not be \nable to hear. They used to think that they were drowning the Voice of Allah; \nin fact, they were piling up misery for themselves, for Allah\u2019s Voice can \nnever be silenced, \u201cAnd those who disbelieve say: \n\nListen not to this Qur\u2019an, and make noise in the midst of its \n(recitation) that you may overcome.\u201d [41:26]. \n\nWhen the unspeakably fascinating Words of Allah came into direct \ncontact with their hearts, they were entranced and got oblivious of the \nmaterialistic world around them and were caught in a state of full \nattentiveness to the Divine Words to such an extent that when the Prophet \nfL., <ui reached the stormy heart-beating ending:", "start_char_idx": 187756, "end_char_idx": 191795, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "852adb3c-e67b-45dc-ba8c-1a6b2361edc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "852adb3c-e67b-45dc-ba8c-1a6b2361edc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "167bf0d0-49e6-4f21-9ff1-7330af0f87bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "00944a426a008b8cb4602f874d647f627d957bcd917d18e37f2173df0cdd508f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e501009f-3466-4854-8ca3-6f53fea4bfdf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1faa5880ced537d01c46a08f089f7d7d9ae7a790ffc4db948e26ddddab32d123", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0417e452284bfb3fd5ff606d6ff9f2a50bd0360d0d3d9a96a70adb4546b6b360", "text": "\u201cSo fall you down in prostration to Allah and worship Him \n(Alone).\u201d [53:62] \n\nThe idolaters, unconsciously and with full compliance, prostrated \nthemselves in absolute god-fearing and stainless devotion.

When they were only an hour\u2019s travel from \nMakkah, the reality of the situation was discovered. Some of them returned \nto Abyssinia (Ethiopia), others sneaked secretly into the city or went in \npublicly but under the tutelage of a local notable. However, due to the news \nthat transpired to the Makkans about the good hospitality and warm \nwelcome that the Muslims were accorded in Abyssinia (Ethiopia), the \npolytheists got terribly indignant and started to mete out severer and more \nhorrible maltreatment and tortures to the Muslims. Thereupon the \nMessenger of Allih ^ deemed it imperative to permit the helpless \n\ncreatures to seek asylum in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) for the second time. \nMigration this time was not as easy as it was the previous time, for Quraish \nwas on the alert to the least suspicious moves of the Muslims. In due course, \nhowever, the Muslims managed their affairs too fast for the Quraishites to \nthwart their attempt of escape. The group of emigrants this time comprised \neighty three, men and nineteen or, in some versions, eighteen women. \nWhether or not \u2018Ammar was included is still a matter of doubt.t'l \n\nQuraish\u2019s Machination against the Emigrants: \n\nQuraish could not tolerate the prospect of a secure haven available for \nthe Muslims in Abyssinia (Ethiopia), so they despatched two staunch \nenvoys to demand their extradition. They were \u2018Amr bin Al-\u2018As and \n\u2018Abdullah bin Abi Rabi\u2018a \u2014 before embracing Islam. They had taken with \nthem valuable gifts to the king and his clergy, and had been able to win \nsome of the courtiers over to their side. The pagan envoys claimed that the \nMuslim refugees should be expelled from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and made \nover to them, on the ground that they had abandoned the religion of their \nforefathers, and their leader was preaching a religion different from theirs \nand from that of the king. \n\nThe king summoned the Muslims to the court and asked them to explain \nthe teachings of their religion. The Muslim emigrants had decided to tell the \n\n\nniTa&eem-ul-Qur\u2019fin, 5/188; Zad Al-Ma\u2018ad, 1/24; Ibn Hisham, 1/364; \nRahmat-ul-liralameen, 1/61 \n\n\n- 102 -", "start_char_idx": 191800, "end_char_idx": 195296, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e501009f-3466-4854-8ca3-6f53fea4bfdf": {"__data__": {"id_": "e501009f-3466-4854-8ca3-6f53fea4bfdf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "852adb3c-e67b-45dc-ba8c-1a6b2361edc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "0417e452284bfb3fd5ff606d6ff9f2a50bd0360d0d3d9a96a70adb4546b6b360", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe04d3e3-877c-486a-9cb1-a059900ece72", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d9e2d046fe571dc1805bc12730495e1fbfa9d70d07932d9ed78510e664d510", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1faa5880ced537d01c46a08f089f7d7d9ae7a790ffc4db948e26ddddab32d123", "text": "niTa&eem-ul-Qur\u2019fin, 5/188; Zad Al-Ma\u2018ad, 1/24; Ibn Hisham, 1/364; \nRahmat-ul-liralameen, 1/61 \n\n\n- 102 - \n\n\nwhole truth whatever the consequences were. Ja\u2018far bin Abi Talib stood up \nand addressed the king in the following words: \u201cO king! we were plunged in \nthe depth of ignorance and barbarism; we adored idols, we lived in \nunchastity, we ate the dead bodies, and we spoke abominations, we \ndisregarded every feeling of humanity, and the duties of hospitality and \nneighbourhood were neglected; we knew no law but that of the strong, when \nAllah raised among us a man, of whose birth, truthfulness, honesty, and \npurity we were aware; and he called to the Oneness of Allah, and taught us \nnot to associate any thin g with Him. He forbade us the worship of idols; and \nhe enjoined us to speak the truth, to be faithful to our trusts, to be merciful \nand to regard the rights of the neighbours and kith and kin; he forbade us to \nspeak evil of women, or to eat the substance of orphans; he ordered us to fly \nfrom the vices, and to abstain from evil; to offer prayers, to render alms, and \nto observe fast We have believed in him, we have accepted his teachings \nand his injunctions to worship Allah, and not to associate anything with \nHim, and we have allowed what He has allowed, and prohibited what He \nhas prohibited. For this reason, our people have risen against us, have \npersecuted us in order to make us forsake the worship of Allah and return to \nthe worship of idols and other abominations. They have tortured and injured \n\nus, until finding no safety among them, we have come to your country, and \n\nhope you will protect us from oppression. \n\nThe kin g was very much impressed by these words and asked the \nMuslims to recite some of Allah\u2019s Revelation. Ja\u2018far recited the opening \nverses of Surah Maryam (Chapter 19 \u2014 Mary) wherein is told the story of \nthe birth of both John and Jesus Christ, down to the account of Mary having \nbeen fed with the food miraculously. Thereupon the king, along with the \nbishops of his realm, was moved to tears that tolled down his cheeks and \neven wet his beard. Here, the Negus exclaimed: \u201cIt seems as if these words \nand those which were revealed to Jesus are the rays of the light which have \nradiated from the same source.\u201d Turning to the crest-fallen envoys of \n\nQuraish, he said, \u201cI am afraid, I cannot give you back these refugees. They \n\nare free to live and worship in my realm as they please.\u201d \n\nOn the morrow, the two envoys again went to the king and said that \nMuhammad and his followers blasphemed Jesus Christ. Again \n\nthe M uslims were summoned and asked what they thought of Jesus.

A \nslave-girl belonging to \u2018Abdullah bin Jada\u2018an, who had noted the \nimpertinence of Abu Jahl, told him the whole story of the attack on the \nProphet . On hearing that, Hamzah was deeply offended and \n\nhurried to Al-Ka\u2018bah and there, in the courtyard of die Holy Sanctuary, \nfound Abu Jahl sitting with a company of Quraishites, Hamzah rushed upon \nhim and struck his bow upon his head violently and said: \u201cAh! You have \nbeen abusing Muhammad ^ v* an ; I too follow his religion and profess \nwhat he preaches.\u201d The men of Bani Makhzum came to his help, and men of \nBani Hashim wanted to render help, but Abu Jahl sent diem away saying: \n\n\n!*!

As he drew near, he \nheard the voice of Khabbab bin Aratt, who was reading the Qur\u2019anic \nChapter Td-Hd (mystic letters, T. H.) to both of them. Khabbab, perceiving \nthe noise of his footsteps retired to a closet. Fatimah, \u2018Umar\u2019s sister, took \nhold of the leaf and hid it. But \u2018Umar had already heard the voice. \u201cWhat \nsound was that I have heard just now?\u201d shouted the son of Khattab, entering \nangrily. Both his sister and her husband replied, \u201cYou heard nothing.\u201d \n\u201cNay,\u201d said he swearing fiercely, \u201cI have heard that you have apostatized.\u201d \nHe plunged forward towards his brother-in-law and beat him severely, but \nFatimah rushed to the rescue of her husband. Thereupon,\u2018Umar fell upon \nhis sister and struck upon her head.

Even then, the food stuff was unjustly \noverpriced so that their financial situation would fall short of finding access \nto it. \n\nHakeem bin Hizam was once on his way to smuggle some wheat to his \naunt Khadijah i\u00abi\u00bb \u00abui ^ when Abu Jahl intercepted and wanted to debar him. \nOnly when Al-Bukhtari intervened, did Hakeem manage to reach his \ndestination.

The latter pleaded impotence, but \nagreed to work with Hisham and form a pressure group that would secure \nthe extrication of the exiles.

Quraish, likewise, repealed the boycott but \nwent on in their atrocities and oppression on the Muslims. Abu Talib, the \noctogenarian notable, was still keen on shielding his nephew but by that \ntime, and on account of the series of tremendous events and continual pains, \nhe began to develop certain fits of weakness. No sooner had he emerged \nvictorious from the inhuman boycott, than he was caught in a persistent \nillness and physical enervation. The polytheists of Makkah, seeing this \nserious situation and fearing that the stain of infamy that the other Arabs \ncould attribute to them in case they took any aggressive action against the \nProphet , 1 -, uji ^ after he had lost his main support, Abu Talib, took a \ndecision to negotiate with the Prophet fU, <ui once more and submit \nsome concessions withheld previously. They then delegated some \nrepresentatives to see Abu Talib and discuss the issue with him . Ibn Ishaq \nand others related: \u201cWhen a serious illness caught Abu Talib, the people of \nQuraish began to deliberate on the situation and reviewed the main features \nthat characterized that period and which included the conversion of\u2018Umar \nand Hamzah to Islam, coupled with the tremendous stir that Muhammad \n^ had created amongst all the tribes of Quraish. They then deemed \nit imperative to see Abu Talib befq^ he died to pressure his nephew to \nnegotiate a compromise on the various disputed points. They were afraid \nthat the other Arabs might attribute to them the charge of opportunism.\u201d \n\nThe delegation of Quraish comprised 25 men including notables like \n\u2018Utbah bin Rabi\u2018a, Shaibah bin Rabi\u2018a, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, Omaiyah bin \nKhalaf, Abu Sufyan bin Harb. They first paid tribute to him and confirmed \ntheir high esteem of his person and position among them. They then shifted \nto the new give-and-take policy that they claimed they wanted to follow. To \nsubstantiate their argument they alleged that they would refrain from \nintervening in his religion if he did the same. \n\nAbu Talib summoned his nephew and apprised him of die minutes of his \nmeeting with them, and said: \u201cWell, my nephew, here are the celebrities of \nyour people.

It is normal to wonder how those people managed to tolerate \nunspeakable persecutions, and stand fast in the face of tyrannical tortures. \nWith respect to these questions, we deem it wise just to touch on those \nunderlying reasons: \n\n\n1. Unshakable Belief in Alldh. The first and foremost factor is no doubt, \nunshakable Belief in Allah Alone coupled with a wonderful degree of \nperception of His Attributes. A man with this Belief deeply averred in his \nheart will look at those foreseen difficulties as triflings and can under no \ncircumstance compare with the sweetness of Belief: \n\n\n\n\u201cThen, as for the foam, it passes away as scum upon the banks, \nwhile that which is for the good of mankind remains in the \nearth.\u201d [13:17] \n\nOther sub-factors that branch out from that Belief and assist in \nstrengthening it and promoting long amity are: \n\n2. Wholeheartedly-loved leadership. Muhammad ^ uii the great \nleader of the Muslim community, and mankind at large, was an \nexemplary man in his perfect manners and noble attributes; no one could \nmeasure up to his endowments of nobility, honesty, trustworthiness and \nabstinence; unanimously and uncontestedly acknowledged even by his \nenemies. Abu Jahl himself, the great enemy of Islam, used repeatedly to \nsay: \u201cO Muhammad (^j uii >), we are in no position to belie you, we \nrather disbelieve what you have brought us (Islam).\u201d It is narrated that \nthree people of Quraish each separately and secretly listened to some \nverses of the Noble Qur\u2019an. Later, this secret was uncovered and one of \nthem asked Abu Jahl (one of the three) what he thought of what he heard \nfrom Muhammad (,j_j uii ^). He answered: We contested the honour \nof leadership and generosity with Banu \u2018Abd Munaf and shared equal \nprivileges competitively. They then began to boast saying that a Prophet \n\n\n- 127 - \n\n\n\nrose among them whom Revelation came down upon from heavens. I \nswear we will never believe in him!' 1 \n\nSo Allah said: \n\n\n\n\n\u201c...

He remained silent but for the third one he remarked, \u201cO \nQuraish! Slaughter is in store for you.\u201d They were taken aback and \nulterior fear filled their hearts to such an extent that the most hostile \namong them began to make up for their insult by the best friendly terms \nthey could afford. When they slung the entrails of a camel on him while \nprostrating himself in prayer, he invoked AllSh\u2019s wrath on them, and they \nimmediately were caught in an inexpressible state of worry and were \nalmost convinced that they would be destroyed. Ubai bin Khalaf used \nalways to threaten he would kill Muhammad ^ <111 j*,. One day the \n\nProphet fL.j 4iii ^ retorted that he would kill him by Allah\u2019s Will. When \nUbai received a scratch in his neck, on the day of Uhud, he, under the \nsense of horror, remembered the Prophet\u2019s words and remarked, \u201cI am \nconvinced he would be able to kill me even if he spat on me. [21 \u201dSa\u2018d bin \nMu'adh said to Omaiyah bin Khalaf in Makkah, \u201cI heard the Messenger \nof Allah ,j_.j \u00abdi one day say that the Muslims would surely kill you.\u201d \nOmaiyah was extremely panicked and swore he would never step out of \nMakkah. Even when Abu Jahl obliged him to march with them to fight \nthe Prophet jj-j <jji ^ on the day of Badr, he bought the best and \nswift camels in Makkah in order that they hasten his escape.. Even his \nwife warned him against going out reminding him of Sa\u2019d\u2019s words, his \n\n\n1,1 Ibn Hisham, 1/316. \nPI ibid* 2/84. \n\n\n- 128 - \n\n\n\nreply was \u201cBy Allah, I have no intention of going out with Quraish, I will \ndisengage from them after a short distance.\u201d!'] \n\nThat was the clear sense of horror and terror haunting his enemies \nwherever they were. His friends and companions, on the other hand, held \nhim dearest to them, and he occupied the innermost cells of their hearts. \nThey were always ready to defend him and secure his well-being even at \nthe risk of their lives. One day, Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafa was severely \nbeaten by \u2018Utbah bin Rabi\u2018a, a terrible polytheist. His whole body was \nalmost bleeding and he was on the verge of death, yet when his people \ntook him back home extremely indignant at his misfortune, he swore he \nwould never eat or drink anything until they had told him about the well\u00ac \nbeing of his noble Companion, Muhammad | 0 _, uii ^u. That was the \nspirit of selflessness and sacrifice that characterized the behaviour of \nthose early Companions. 12 ] \n\n3. The sense of responsibility. The early Companions were fully aware of \nthe daunting responsibility they were expected to shoulder. They were \nalso convinced that those charges were inescapable even though they \nwere being persecuted for fear of the far-reaching ramifications, and the \nhorrible impact that humanity would suffer in case they shirked their \nobligations. \n\n4. Unwavering Belief in the truth of the Hereafter. This was the corner\u00ac \nstone that strengthened their sense of responsibility. There was a deep \ncertainty established through the light of their religion that one day they \nwould have to rise on the Day of Resurrection and account for all \nworldly deeds, small or big. They were sure that their future in the other \nworld would depend wholly on their acts in their provisional life on \nearth, either to everlasting Garden (Paradise) or perpetual chastisement in \nHell. Their whole life was divided between hope for Allah\u2019s mercy and \nfear of His punishment. \n\n\n4 jity dl (\u00a3' OjJ> 4 \n\n\nfl) Sahih Al-Bukhari, 2/563. \n\nPI Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, 3/30. \n\n\n- 129 -", "start_char_idx": 248241, "end_char_idx": 252107, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33b10184-acf2-4e3c-92d1-2cbea6cac781": {"__data__": {"id_": "33b10184-acf2-4e3c-92d1-2cbea6cac781", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9bc6e7a9-e2bf-4139-ad25-418c64745c1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "4dedba4f986a0278929af5b667af2675c3c9a143d11b86bae5944fb1f35e008b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "47f3eba5-3b5b-4590-998e-11c449efaab4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38e3880f4957f02a80e7cc4d4f47efa63ef507687b7ea6c1801fb7af05c18621", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5a32052f7674f2fc6a71c73d7462ef43f287a452dcb6e2b783ef56b09a71d631", "text": "4 jity dl (\u00a3' OjJ> 4 \n\n\nfl) Sahih Al-Bukhari, 2/563. \n\nPI Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, 3/30. \n\n\n- 129 - \n\n\n\n\"... who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do \nother good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their \nalms and charities, etc., have been accepted or not), because \nthey are sure to return to their Lord.\u201d [23:60] \n\nThey had already known that life with all its amenities and pains was \nworthless when compared with the Hereafter.

On the other hand, the Noble Qur\u2019an was leading the Muslims \nto a new world and enlightening them as to its features, the beauty of \nLordship, the perfection of Godship, the impact of kindness and mercy \nand the manifestations of the yearned for Allah\u2019s pleasure. They \nimplicitly connoted meaningful messages carrying glad tidings of \ndefinitely approaching Divine Mercy leading to eternal bliss in a blissful \nGarden (Paradise).

Glad tidings of success. Ever since the time they experienced the \nadversities of life, the Muslims had been certain that entrance into the \nfold of Islam did not entail involvement into hardships or digging one\u2019s \nown grave. They had been aware that the Islamic Call had one goal, viz \nextermination of pre-Islamic tradition and destroying its iniquitous \nsystem, to go on parallel lines with extending its influence allover the \nearth and holding in firm control the political situation worldwide to lead \nhumanity along a course conducive to Allah\u2019s Pleasure, and perfect \nenough to rid people of worshipping Allah\u2019s servant to worshipping \nAllah, Himself. Glad tidings of this sort were being revealed sometimes \nexplicitly and at other times implicitly, in a manner relevant to the \nsituation. When the Muslims were forced to undergo constraints, or when \ntheir life was kept under continual restraint, there would be revealed \nverses telling identical stories of past Prophets with their people and the \nsufferings and pains they had experienced. The verses would also include \n\n\n- 131 - \n\n\n\nsuggestive clues to the final tragic end of the Makkan disbelievers \nenvisaging their final perdition, yet and at the same time, bearing glad \ntidings to the believers and promising the true servants of vicegerency on \nearth to go with absolute success, and victory to attend the Islamic Call \nand its proponents. \n\nHere we could adduce some of the verses of this category pregnant \nwith glad tidings referring to the final victory that would crown the \nperseverance and patience of the Muslims: \n\n\n'a&iJ fi fix o C&.J& I ua 123 TJifj> \n\nJji lj^ O yj\u00bb- fit- <Syj O", "start_char_idx": 253255, "end_char_idx": 257044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0c98e07-10a7-4ef9-a61c-7a09483f6b3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0c98e07-10a7-4ef9-a61c-7a09483f6b3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47f3eba5-3b5b-4590-998e-11c449efaab4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "38e3880f4957f02a80e7cc4d4f47efa63ef507687b7ea6c1801fb7af05c18621", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68ac7b52-7c12-468e-a91e-a47501db4256", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8cfde8e053b352b317204a506d531abe4d8f2fd1042847537a986e9396d5d5f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8fc0f3f985bced8ac6cf0bd2e4e306fcc9bea44ac1b94a3f570768f0bc7b6ad7", "text": "- 131 - \n\n\n\nsuggestive clues to the final tragic end of the Makkan disbelievers \nenvisaging their final perdition, yet and at the same time, bearing glad \ntidings to the believers and promising the true servants of vicegerency on \nearth to go with absolute success, and victory to attend the Islamic Call \nand its proponents. \n\nHere we could adduce some of the verses of this category pregnant \nwith glad tidings referring to the final victory that would crown the \nperseverance and patience of the Muslims: \n\n\n'a&iJ fi fix o C&.J& I ua 123 TJifj> \n\nJji lj^ O yj\u00bb- fit- <Syj O \n\n\n\u201cAnd, verily.

And there is no power nor resource, but Yours \nalone.\u201d \n\nSeeing him in this helpless situation, Rabi\u2018a\u2019s two sons, wealthy \nMakkans, were moved on grounds of kinship and compassion, and sent to \nhim one of their Christian servants with a tray of grapes. The Prophet \nf i - j . ; i. 4 _m accepted the fruit with pious invocation: \u201cIn the Name of the \nAllah.\u201d The Christian servant \u2018Addas was greatly impressed by these words \nand said: \u201cThese are words which people in this land do not generally use. \nThe Prophet ^ ^ inquired of him whence he came and what religion \n\nhe professed. \u2018Addas replied: \u201cI am a Christian by faith and come from \nNineveh.\u201d The Prophet ^ ^ then said: \u201cYou belong to the city of the \n\nrighteous Jonah, son of Matta.\u201d \u2018Addas asked him anxiously if he knew \nanything about Jonah. The Prophet , 1 -,*!. > significantly remarked: \u201cHe \n\nis my brother. He was a Prophet and so am I.\u201d Thereupon \u2018Addas paid \nhomage to Muhammad ^ uii and kissed his hands. His masters \nadmonished him at this act but he replied: \u201cNone on the earth is better than \nhe is. He has revealed to me a truth which only a Prophet can do.\u201d They \nagain reprimanded him and said: \u201cWe forewarn *\u25a0 you against the \nconsequences of abandoning the faith of your forefathers. The religion \nwhich you profess is far better than the one you feel inclined to. \n\n\n- 137 - \n\n\n\nHeart-broken and depressed, Muhammad pL-j 4 * 1 * <di ^ set out on the way \nback to Makkah. When he reached Qam Al-Manazil, Allah, the Almi ghty \nsent him Gabriel together with the angel of mountains. The latter asked the \nProphet ^ 4 U 1 ^ for permission to bury Makkah between Al-Akh$habain \n\n\u2014Abu Qubais and Qu\u2018ayqa\u2018an mountains. Full narration of this event was \ngiven by \u2018Aishah l** uji ^ (the Prophet\u2019s spouse). She said: \u201cI asked the \nProphet pL-j ^ if he had ever experienced a worse day than Uhud. He \nanswered that he had suffered a lot from those people (the idolaters) but the \nmost painful was on the day of \u2018Aqabah. I went seeking support from Ibn \n\u2018Abd Yalil bin \u2018Abd Kalal, but he spumed me. I set out wearied and grieved \nheedless of anything around me until I suddenly realized I was in Qam \nAth-Tha\u2018alib, called Qam Al-Manazil. There, I looked up and saw a cloud \ncasting its shade on me, and Gabriel addressing me: Allah has heard your \npeople\u2019s words and sent you the angel of mountains to your aid. The latter \ncalled and gave me his greetings and asked for my permission to bury \nMakkah between Al-Akhshabain, the two moun tains flanking Makkah.

He addressed Bani \u2018Amir bin Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah in their encampment, calling them \nto abandon idolatry and join him. One of them called Buhairah bin Firras, \nanswered him back: \u201cShould we give you allegiance and Allah give you \npower over your opponents, will you give us right to inheritance and \nsucceed you in power?\u201d The Prophet replied: \u201cThe whole affair lies in \nAllah\u2019s Hands. He gives the power to whomever He desires.\u201d The man \ncommented: \u201cDo you expect us to incur the wrath and vengeance of the \nArabs without the least hope of leadership?

At this invitation, Swaid imparted to the Prophet some \nsound words from Luqman\u2019s wisdom. The Prophet approved of that \nwisdom but told the man that he had something far better. He recited \nsome verses from the Qur\u2019an, the man listened meditatively and the \nwords appealed to his originally pine nature and accepted Islam as his \nfaith at once.

However, glimpses of propitious lights were looming \non the distant horizon, to ultimately materialize in the event of the Prophet\u2019s \nNight Journey to Jerusalem and then Ascension through the spheres of the \nheavens. \n\nAs for its exact date, it is still controversial and no common consent has \nbeen reached. However, the majority of jurists is in favour of a date between \n16-12 months prior to migration to Madinah. The following is a epitome of \nthe details of that miraculous event narrated on the authority of Ibn \nAl-Qayyim.I 1 ] \n\nThe Messenger of Allah ^ \u00abui ju was carried in body from the Sacred \nMosque in Makkah to the Distant Mosque in Jerusalem on a horse called \nAl-Buraq in the company of Gabriel, the archangel. There he alighted, \ntethered the horse to a ring in the gate of the Mosque and led the Prophets in \nprayer. After that Gabriel took him to the heavens on the same horse. When \nthey reached the first heaven Gabriel asked the guardian angel to open the \ndoor of heaven. It was opened and he saw Adam, the progenitor of mankind. \nThe Prophet ^ uji ^ saluted him and the other welcomed him and \nexpressed his faith in Muhammad\u2019s Prophethood. He saw the souls of \nmartyrs on his right and those of the wretched on his left. \n\nGabfiel then ascended with the Prophet to the second heaven, asked for \nop ening the gate and there he saw and saluted John, son ofZachariya \n(Yahya bin Zakariya) and Jesus, son of Mary. They returned the salutation, \nwelcomed him and expressed their faith in his Prophethood. Then they \nreached the third heaven where they saw Joseph (Yusuf) and saluted him. \nThe latter welcomed the Prophet and expressed fai(h in his Prophethood. \nThe Prophet, in the company of Gabriel, then reached the fourth heaven \n\n\nI'l ZM Al-M a\u2018ad, 2/49; Tareekh-e-Islam, 1/124; Rahmat-al-lil\u2018alameen, 1/76. \n\n\n- 147 -", "start_char_idx": 285985, "end_char_idx": 288257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6abaf492-781e-4788-a5c6-d749e67548cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "6abaf492-781e-4788-a5c6-d749e67548cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9007d345-ca72-480e-9cbd-02b956c13050", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "05e9e82114ebc862b36e250edf7eebfdb3032db4fcf0fe295e71e55711c4b7d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "baa8d72e-8eb8-4f0c-83e2-56658a10dde0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60b575f32317fbc91c262ed812124e89eae85a70f0e9f6252af0fa2a0162ecf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "de82e1723b9f8b42bed0ed96ed5b23e36a8e8085f6cea7db706816050b19a2f6", "text": "I'l ZM Al-M a\u2018ad, 2/49; Tareekh-e-Islam, 1/124; Rahmat-al-lil\u2018alameen, 1/76. \n\n\n- 147 - \n\n\n\n\nwhere he met the Prophet Enoch (Idris) and saluted him.

The latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in hi? \nProphethood. In the sixth heaven he met Moses (Musa) and saluted him. \nThe latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. \nMuhammad ^ ^ on leaving, saw that Moses began to weep. He asked \n\nabout the reason. Moses answered that he was weeping because he \nwitnessed a man sent after him as a Messenger (Muhammad) who was able \nto lead more of his people to the Paradise than he himself did. Then Prophet \nMuhammad , 1 -, <jii ^ reached the seventh heaven and met Abraham \n(Ibrahim) f *_ji and saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and \nexpressed faith in his Prophethood.

He \nwas then presented to the Divine Presence and experienced the thrill of \nwitnessing the Divine Glory and Manifestation at the closest possible \npropinquity. There the Lord revealed unto His servant that which He \nrevealed, and ordained fifty daily prayers for him. On his return, he spoke to \nMoses that his followers had been enjoined to pray fifty times a day. Moses \naddressing the Prophet ^ said: \u201cYour followers cannot perform so \n\nmany prayers. Go back to your Lord and ask for a remission in number.\u201d \nThe Prophet \u00ab*u \u00abjii ^ turned to Gabriel as if holding counsel with him. \nGabriel nodded, \u201cYes, if you desire,\u201d and ascended with him to the Presence \nof Allah. The All-Mighty Allah, Glory is to Him, made a reduction of ten \nprayers. He then descended and reported that to Moses, who again urged \nhim to request for a further reduction. Muhammad fu, \u00ab*u \u00abjji ju once more \nbegged his Lord to reduce the number still further. He went again and again \nin the Presence of Allah at the suggestion of Moses for reduction in the \nnumber of prayers till these were reduced to five only. Moses again asked \nhim to implore for more reduction, but he said: \u201cI feel ashamed now of \nrepeatedly asking my Lord for reduction. I accept and resign to His Will.\u201d \nWhen Muhammad ^ \u00abjii ^jl. went farther, a Caller was heard saying: \u201cI \nhave imposed My Ordinance and alleviated the burden of My servants.\u201d \n\n\n- 148 -", "start_char_idx": 288170, "end_char_idx": 290891, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "baa8d72e-8eb8-4f0c-83e2-56658a10dde0": {"__data__": {"id_": "baa8d72e-8eb8-4f0c-83e2-56658a10dde0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6abaf492-781e-4788-a5c6-d749e67548cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "de82e1723b9f8b42bed0ed96ed5b23e36a8e8085f6cea7db706816050b19a2f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "744e1e54-a0b1-42ab-8873-ceca93849bf8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad4944999a85a41dc9fb95db9a33bd10f655583461d2c11bc40a3f42a741058d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "60b575f32317fbc91c262ed812124e89eae85a70f0e9f6252af0fa2a0162ecf9", "text": "- 148 - \n\n\n\nThere is however some difference as regards the issue whether the \nProphet saw Allah with his physical eye or not. Some interpreters say that \nseeing Allah with his naked eyes was not confirmed. Ibn \u2018Abbas, on the \nother hand, says that the word Ru 'ya as used in the Noble Qur\u2019an signifies \nthe observation with the help of the eye. \n\nIn Surah An-Najm (Chapter \u2014The Star) we read: \n\n\u201cThen he approached and came closer.\u201d [53:8] \n\nHere (he) refers to archangel Gabriel, and this context is completely \ndifferent from that in the Prophetic tradition of Isra \u2019 and Mi \u2018raj, where \u2018the \napproach\u2019 relates to that of the Lord, Glory is to Him. \n\nSome significant suggestive incidents featured the \u2018Night Journey\u2019 of the \nProphet, of which we could mention: \n\n1. The Prophet\u2019s breast was cleft by Gabriel, his heart extracted and washed \nwith the water of Zamzam \u2014a sacred spring in Makkah. \n\n2. In the same context, there were brought to him two gold vessels. There \nwas milk in one, while the other was full of wine. He was asked to \nchoose either of them, so he selected the vessel containing milk and \ndrank it. He (the angel) said: \u201cYou have been guided on Al-Fitrah or you \nhave attained Al-Fitrah. Had you selected wine, your nation would have \nbeen misled.\u201d [It is a symbolic way of saying that good and evil in the \nform of milk and wine were brought before the Prophet and he \ninstinctively made a choice for the good. It is very difficult to render the \nArabic term \u2018Fitrah \u2019 into English. It denotes the original constitution or \ndisposition, with which a child comes into this world, as contrasted with \nqualities or inclinations acquired during life; besides it refers to the \nspiritual inclination inherent in man in his unspoilt state]. \n\n3. The Prophet ^ \u00abw told that he saw two manifest rivers, \u2014 the Nile \nand the Euphrates \u2014 and two hidden ones. It appears that the two \nmani fest rivers, the Nile and the Euphrates, symbolically describe the \narea in whose fertile valleys, Muhammad\u2019s Message will settle, and the \npeople whereof will always remain the adherent bearers of Islam that will \n\n\n- 149 -", "start_char_idx": 290884, "end_char_idx": 293011, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "744e1e54-a0b1-42ab-8873-ceca93849bf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "744e1e54-a0b1-42ab-8873-ceca93849bf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "baa8d72e-8eb8-4f0c-83e2-56658a10dde0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "60b575f32317fbc91c262ed812124e89eae85a70f0e9f6252af0fa2a0162ecf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d6c2bd1-5844-4483-91c8-e6dd8550835b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5a067d351f6c44cdebe989e71904b362579a32375f3b88759f2bcebdf1e22c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ad4944999a85a41dc9fb95db9a33bd10f655583461d2c11bc40a3f42a741058d", "text": "- 149 - \n\n\n\nbe passed on from generation to another.

Therein, he saw the Hell dwellers, of whom \nwere those who unjustly eat up the property of the orphans. They have \nflews similar to those of camels, swallowing red-hot stones and then \nissuing out of their backs. There were also the people who take usury \nwith bellies too big to be able to move around; they are trodden by the \npeople of Pharaoh when these are admitted into Hell. In the same abode, \nhe saw the adulterers offered tasty fatty meat and rotten smelly one but \nthey make option for the latter. The licentious women were also there \nhanging from their breasts. \n\n5. The \u2018Night Journey\u2019raised a good deal of stir among the people and the \nsceptical audience plied Muhammad with all sorts of questions. He told \nthem that he saw the camels of Makkan merchants to and fro. He also \nguided them to some of their animals that went astray. He informed them \nthat he had drunk some of their water while they were fast asleep and left \nthe container covered. \n\nThe disbelievers, however, found it a suitable opportunity to jeer at the \nMuslims and their creed. They pestered the Prophet with \n\nquestions as to the description of the Mosque at Jerusalem, where he had \nnever gone before and, to the astonishment of many, the Prophet\u2019s replies \nfurnished the most accurate information about that city. He supplied them \nwith all the news about their caravans and the routes of their camels. \nHowever, all this increased in them nothing but flight from the Truth, and \nthey accepted nothing but disbelief.! 1 ! \n\nFor the true Muslims, however there was nothing unusual about the \nNight Journey. The All-Mighty Allah, Who is Powerful enough to have \ncreated the heavens and the earth by an act of His Will, is surely Powerful \nenough to take His Messenger beyond the heavens and show him those \nsigns of His at firsthand which are inaccessible to man otherwise.

This arrangement is not in fact a mere coincidence. Jerusalem was the \nfirst scene of the Night Journey, and here lies the message directed to the \nJews and which explicitly suggested that they would be discharged of the \noffice of leadership of mankind due to the crimes they had perpetrated and \nwhich no longer justified their occupation of that office. The message \nsuggested explicitly that the office of leadership would be reinstituted by the \nMessenger of Allah ,jl, \u00ab<u to hold in his hand both headquarters of the \nAbrahamic Faith, the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah and the Farthest Mosque in \nJerusalem. It was high time for the spiritual authority to be transferred from \na nation whose history got pregnant with treachery, covenant-breaching and \naggression to another nation blessed with piety, and dutifulness to Allah, \nwith a Messenger who enjoys the privilege of the Qur\u2019anic Revelation, \nwhich leads to that which is best and right. \n\nThere, however, remains a crucial question waiting to be answered: How \ncould this foreseen transition of authority be effected while the champion \nhimself (Muhammad) was left deserted and forsaken stumbling in the \nhillocks of Makkah? This question per se uncovered the secrets of another \nissue which referred to a phase of the Islamic Call and the appearance of \nanother role it was about to take up, different in its course and noble in its \napproaches. The forerunners of that new task took the shape of Qur\u2019anic \nverses smacking of direct and unequivocal warning accompanied by a \nsevere ultimatum directed to the polytheists and their agents: \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd when We decide to destroy a town (population). We (first) \nsend a definite order (to obey Allah and be righteous) to those \namong them [ or We (first) increase in number those of its \npopulation] who are given the good* things of this life. Then, \nthey transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is \njustified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete \ndestruction. And how many generations (past nations) have We \n\n\n- 152 - \n\n\n\ndestroyed after Noah! And Sufficient is your Lord as an All- \nKnower and All-Beholder of the sins of His slaves.\u201d [17:16, 17] \n\nTogether with these verses, there were others revealed to show the \nMuslims the rules and items of the civilization upon which they could erect \ntheir Muslim community, and foreshadowing their ownership of a piece of \nland, exercising full freedom over it and establishing a coherent society \naround whose axis the whole humanity would rotate. Those verses in reality \nimplied better prospects for the Prophet <-w ^ comprising a secure \nshelter to settle in, and headquarters safe enough to empower and embolden \nhim to communicate his Message to all the world at large; that was in fact \nthe inner secret of that blessed journey.

As\u2018ad bin Zurarah \nhosted him in Madinah. So prepared was the ground, and so zealous the \npropagation that the Islam spread rapidly from house to house and from \ntribe to tribe. There were various cheerful and promising aspects of success \nthat characterized Mus\u2018ab\u2019s task.

Usaid came closer cursing and \nswearing and accused the two men of befooling people weak of heart, and \nordered that they stop it altogether. Mus\u2018ab calmly invited him to sit saying, \n\u201cIf you are pleased with our talk, you can accept it; should you hold it in \nabhorrence, you could freely immunize yourself against what you hate.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d said Usaid, pierced his lance in the sand, listened to Mus\u2019ab \nand then heard some verses of the Noble Qur\u2019an. His face bespoke \nsatisfaction and pleasure before uttering any words of approval. He asked \nthe two men about the procedures pertinent to embracing Islam. They asked \nhim to observe washing, purge his garment, bear witness to the Truth and \nthen perform two Rak'a. He responded and did exactly what he was asked \nto do, and then said there was a man (Sa\u2018d bin Mu'adh) whose people would \nnever hang back if he followed the Islam. He then left to see Sa\u2018d and his \npeople. Sa\u2018d could immediately understand that Usaid had changed. To a \nquestion posed by Sa\u2018d, Usaid said that two men were ready to comply with \nwhatever orders they received. He then managed a certain situation that \nprovided the two men with a chance to talk with Sa\u2018d privately. The \nprevious scene with Usaid recurred and Sa\u2018d embraced Islam, and directly \nturned to his people swearing that he would never talk with them until they \nhad believed in Allah, and in His Messenger. Hardly did the evening of that \nday arrive when all the men and women of that sept of Arabians embraced \nIslam with the exception of one, Al-Usairim, who hung back until the Day \nof Uhud.

Now, back to \nyour camps.\u201d They went back to sleep till morning, t\u2019l \n\nNo sooner did Quraish hear of this treaty than a kind of trouble- \nprovoking tumult began to mushroom in all directions. They realized quite \nfully that an allegiance of this sort is bound to produce far-reaching \nramifications of direct impact on their lives and wealth. The following day, \na large delegation comprising the leaders and arch-criminals of Makkah set \nout for the camp of the Madinese to protest severely against the treaty. They \naddressed the Madinese: \u201cO people of Khazraj, it transpired to us that you \nhave come here to conclude a treaty with this man (Muhammad) and \nevacuate him out of Makkah. By Allah, we do really hold in abhorrence any \nsort of fight between you and us.\u201dt 2 l \n\nThe Madinese polytheists having known nothing about the secretly taken \npledge, began to swear by Allah and answered in good faith that there was \nno truth in the report. \u2018Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, a Madinese polytheist, \nrefuted their allegations denouncing them as null and void, claiming that his \npeople would never initiate anything unless he gave them clear orders. \n\nThe Madinese Muslims, however, remained silent neither negating nor \nconfirming. The Quraishite leaders seemed to be almost convinced by the \narguments presented by the polytheists, and went back home frustrated. \nHowever, they did not fully acquiesce in the words they heard. They began \nto scrutinize the smallest details, and trace the minutest news till it was \nestablished beyond a shadow of doubt that the pact did take place, but that \nwas after the Madinese pilgrims had left Makkah.

This new \nspirit of affection, rapport and cooperation could never be attributable to a \nfleeing whim, on the contrary, it totally derived from an already deeply- \nestablished approach, viz. Belief in Allah, His Messenger and His Book.

The \nfuture was foggy, pregnant with various unpredictable sorts of sorrows and \ncrises. \n\nBearing all this in mind, the Muslims began to migrate, while the \npolytheists spared no effort in hindering and debarring them, knowing \nbeforehand that such a move implied unimaginable threats and unthinkable \ndestructive dangers to their whole society: \n\n1. The first one to migrate was Abu Salamah, a year before the Great \n\u2018Aqabah Pledge. When he had made up his mind to leave Makkah, his in\u00ac \nlaws, in a desperate attempt to raise obstacles, detained his wife and \nsnatched his son and dislocated his hand. Umm Salamah, after the \ndeparture of her husband and the loss of her son spent a year by herself \nweeping and lamenting. A relative of hers eventually had pity on her and \nexhorted the others to release her son and let her join her husband. She \nthen set out on a journey of 500 kilometres with no help whatsoever. At a \nspot called At-Tan\u2018im, \u2018Uthman bin Talhah came across her and offered \nto give her a ride to Madinah. She, along with her son, joined Abu \nSalamah in the village of Quba\u2019, a suburb of Madinah.! 1 ! \n\n2.

The party of three then set forth towards Makkah. \nAs soon as they covered part of the distance, Abu Jahl complained about his \ncamel and requested \u2018Ayyash to allow him to ride behind him on his camel. \nWhen they knelt down to the level of the ground, the two polytheists fell \nupon \u2018Ayyash and tied him.

Nevertheless, the believers still \nmanaged to escape in successive groups and so rapidly that within two \nmonths of the Second \u2018Aqabah Pledge, entire quarters of Makkah were \ndeserted. Almost all the followers of Muhammad had migrated to their new \nabode, except Abu Bakr, \u2018Ali, the Prophet ^ \u00abui ^ himself, and those \nhelpless noble souls who had been detained in confinement or were unable \nto escape.

Abu Bakr was, however, urging the Prophet to \ndepart from that town. He was also eagerly waiting for an opportunity to \naccompany Muhammad on this eventful journey. But the Prophet \n\ntold him that the time had not yet come; the Lord had not given him the \ncommand to migrate.

Hence \nit was incumbent upon every capable Muslim to contribute to building this \nnew homeland, immunizing it and holding up its prop. As a leader and \nspiritual guide, there was no doubt the Noble Messenger ^ in \n\nwhose hands exclusively all affairs would be resolved. \n\nIn Madinah, the Prophet had to deal with three distinctively \n\ndifferent categories of people with different respective problems: \n\n1. His Companions, the noble and Allah fearing elite ^ ^ \n\n2. Polytheists still detached from the Islam and were purely Madinese \ntribes. \n\n3. The Jews. \n\n1. As for his Companions, the conditions of life in Madinah were totally \ndifferent from those they experienced in Makkah. There, in Makkah, they \nused to strive for one corporate target, but physically, they were \nscattered, overpowered and forsaken. They were helpless in terms of \npursuing their new course of orientation. Their means, socially and \nmate rially, fell short of establishing a new Muslim community. In \nparallel lines, the Makkan Chapters of the Noble Qur\u2019an were confined to \ndelineating the Islamic precepts, enacting legislations pertaining to the \nbelievers individually and enjoining good and piety and forbidding evils \nand vices. \n\nIn Madinah , thing s were otherwise; here all the affairs of their life \nrested in their hands. Now, they were at ease and could quite confidently \nhandle the chal len ges of civilization, construction, means of living, \neconomics, politics, government administration, war and peace, \ncodification of the questions of the allowed and prohibited, worship, \n\nethics and all the relevant issues. In a nutshell, they were in Madinah at \nfull liberty to erect the pillars of a new Muslim community not only \n\n\n- 181 - \n\n\n\nutterly different from that pre-Islamic code of life, but also distinctive in \nits features in the world at large. It was a society that could stand for the \nIslamic Call for whose sake the Muslims had been put to unspeakable \ntortures for 10 years. No doubt, the construction of a society that runs in \nline with this type of ethics cannot be accomplished overnight, within a \nmonth or a year. It requires a long time to build during which legislation \nand legalization will run gradually in a complementary process with \nmind cultivation, training and education.

In fact, this very \npurpose lay at the heart of the Islamic Call and the Muhammadan \nmission; it was never an incidental issue though there were the matters \nthat required urgent addressing. \n\nThe Muslims in Madinah consisted virtually of two parties: The first \none already settled down in their abode, land and wealth, fully at ease, \nbut seeds of discord amongst them were deeply seated and chronic \nenmity continually evoked; they were Al-Ansar (the Helpers). The \nsecond party were Al-Muhajirun (the Emigrants), homeless, jobless and \n\n\n- 182 - \n\n\n\npenniless. Their number was not small, on the contrary, it was increasing \nday by day after the Prophet fU, <jji had given them the green light to \nleave for Madinah whose economic structure, originally not that \nprosperous one, began to show signs of imbalance aggravated by the \neconomic boycott that the anti-Islamic groups imposed and consequently \nimports diminished and living conditions worsened. \n\n2. The purely Madinese polytheists constituted the second sector with \nwhom the Prophet ^ <ui had to deal. Those people had no control at \nall over the Muslim. Some of them mused no grudge against the \nMuslims, but were rather skeptical of their ancestors\u2019 religious practices, \nand developed tentative inclination towards Islam and before long they \nembraced the new faith and were truly devoted to Allah. However, some \nothers harboured evil intentions against the Prophet ^ *ui j*, and his \nfollowers but were too cowardly to resist them publicly, they were rather, \nunder those Islamically favourable conditions, obliged to fake \namicability and friendliness. \u2018Abdullah bin Ubai, who had almost been \ngiven presidency over Al-Khazraj and Al-Aws tribes in the wake of \nBu\u2018ath War between the two tribes, came at the head of that group of \nhypocrites. The Prophet\u2019s advent and the vigorous rise of the new spirit \nof Islam foiled that orientation and the idea soon went into oblivion. He, \nseeing another one, Muhammad ^ <<u \u00abui coming to deprive him and \nhis agents of the prospective temporal privileges, could not be pleased, \nand for overriding reasons he showed pretension to Islam but with \nhorrible disbelief deeply-rooted in his heart. He also used to exploit some \nevents and weak-hearted new converts in scheming malevolently against \nthe true believers. \n\n3. The Jews (the Hebrews), who had migrated to Al-Hijaz from Syria \nfollowing the Byzantine and Assyrian persecution campaigns, were the \nthird category existent on the demographic scene in Madinah. In their \nnew abode they assumed the Arabian stamp in dress, language and \nmanner of life and there were instances of intermarriage with the local \nArabs, however they retained their ethnic particularism and detached \nthemselves from amalgamation with the immediate environment. They \neven used to pride in their Jewish-Israeli origin, and spurn the Arabs \naround designating them as illiterate meaning brutal, naive and \nbackward. They desired the wealth of their neighbours to be made lawful \nto them and they could thus appropriate it the way they liked. \n\n\n- 183 -", "start_char_idx": 351556, "end_char_idx": 355406, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9974ec8a-c86d-4103-afec-afb2ac0e8582": {"__data__": {"id_": "9974ec8a-c86d-4103-afec-afb2ac0e8582", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f41c418-ec67-49c8-b53b-63998f26aabd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "41e8061188069e71ca3468840818836b21062bcb8a508013a4b094253139e381", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d3bd611-bce1-4b38-bd23-b76843ec308c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f14866bb6056b689ac8377807e4a1ae97bb8ebe04dd7250d477ddcb0f52a96f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "160fca695a1be722484454290f80ebcd7f424bd08480ed721264a7c4f2a707c4", "text": "- 183 - \n\n\n\n... because they say: \u201cThere is no blame on us to betray and \ntake the properties of the illiterates (Arabs)\u201d [3:75] \n\nReligiously, they showed no zeal; their most obvious religious \ncommodity was fortunetelling, witchcraft and the secret arts (blowing on \nknots), for which they used to attach to themselves advantages of science \nand spiritual precedence. \n\nThey excelled at the arts of earning money and trading. They in fact \nmonopolized trading in cereals, dates, wine, clothes, export and import. For \nthe services they offered to the Arabs, the latter paid heavily.

The Prophet ^ <ui ^ sent for \nsome Jews and asked them about \u2018Abdullah bin Salam, they testified to his \nscholarly aptitude and virtuous standing.

Five hundred \nkilometres away in Makkah, there still lay another source of detrimental \nthreat, the archenemy of Islam, Quraish. For ten years, while at the mercy of \nQuraish, the Muslims were subjected to all sorts of terrorism, boycott, \nharassment and starvation coupled by a large scale painstaking \npsychological war and aggressive organized propaganda. When they had \nemigrated to Madinah, their land, wealth and property were seized, wives \ndetained and the socially humble in rank brutally tortured. Quraish also \nschemed and made attempts on the life of the first figure of the Call, \nMuhammad . Due to their acknowledged temporal leadership \n\nand religious supremacy among the pagan Arabs, given the custodianship of \nthe Sacred Sanctuary, the Quraishites spared no effort in enticing the \nArabians against Madinah and boycotting the Madinese socially and \neconomically. To quote Muhammad Al-Ghazali: \u201cA state of war virtually \nexisted between the Makkan tyrants and the Muslims in their abode.

It was square in form, each side measuring \napproximately 100 yards, facing towards the north and having three gates on \neach of the remaining sides. Nearby, rooms reserved for the Prophet\u2019s \nhousehold were built of stones and adobe bricks with ceilings of palm \nleaves.!'1 To the north of the Mosque a place was reserved for the Muslims \nwho had neither family nor home. The Adhan (summoning the Muslims to \nthe Mosque by the Call for prayer) was initiated at this early stage of post- \nmigration era. The Mosque was not merely a locus to perform prayers, but \nrather an Islamic league where the Muslim\u2019s were instructed in Islam and its \ndoctrines. It served as an assembly place where the conflicting pre-Islamic \ntrends used to come to terms; it was the headquarter wherein all the affairs \nof the Muslims were administered, and consultative and executive councils \nheld.", "start_char_idx": 360147, "end_char_idx": 364327, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6017793e-1fbd-4767-8b8a-8530edcab51d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6017793e-1fbd-4767-8b8a-8530edcab51d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b5de602-d855-4acb-a245-737b83aa4fa2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "0f02377a1276234b7c573e917114492e06a9c4e4e22999144852746d0abec380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94636903-43bb-4fb2-84b9-4ffcc88b6f40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68e6914309d04eec225724f45e2d8149deec38f294184d9505e97fe6252fefae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ece080d74c53285ee2aa7ceb1b4bf2d73219eb37d20c5538cc4c4a927c4dd58b", "text": "[1] Sahih Al-Bukhari, 1/71,555, 560; Zad Al-Ma\u2018ad, 2/56. \n\n\n- 187 - \n\n\n\nThe Mosque being thus constructed, the Prophet next turned \n\nhis attention to cementing the ties of mutual brotherhood amongst the \nMuslims of Madinah, Al-Ansar (the Helpers) and Al-Muhajirun (the \nEmigrants). It was indeed unique in the history of the world. A gathering of \n90 men, half of whom Emigrants and the others Helpers assembled in the \nhouse of Anas bin Malik where the Prophet gave the spirit of \n\nbrotherhood his official blessing. When either of the two persons who had \nbeen paired as brothers, passed away, his property was inherited by his \nbrother-in-faith. This practice continued till the following verse was \nrevealed at the time of the battle of Badr, and the regular rule of inheritance \nwas allowed to take its usual course: \n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut kindred by blood are nearer to one another regarding \ninheritance! 1 ).\u201d [8:75] \n\n\n\u201cBrotherhood-in-faith\u201d to quote Muhammad Al-Ghazali again, \u201cwas \nholding subordinate every distinction of race and kindred and suppor ting the \nIslamic precept: none is superior to the other except on the basis of piety \nand God-fearin g PI\u201d \n\n\nThe Prophet ^ attached to that brotherhood a valid contract; it \n\nwas not just meaningless words but rather a valid practice rela ting to blood \nand wealth rather than a passing whim taking the form of accidental \ngreeting. \n\n\nThe atmosphere of brotherhood and fellow-feeling created a spirit of \nselflessness infused deeply in the hearts of his followers, and produced very \nhealthy results. For example, Sa\u2018d bin Ar-Rabi\u2018, a Helper, said to his fellow \nbrother \u2018Abdur Rahman bin \u2018Awf, \u201cI am the richest man among st the \nHelpers. I am glad to share my property half and half with you. I have two \nwives, I am ready to divorce one and after the expiry of her \u2018Iddah, (the \nprescribed period for a woman divorcee to stay wi thin her house unmarried) \nyou may marry her.\u201d But \u2018Abdur Rahman bin \u2018Awf was not prepared to \n\n\n('] Zfid Al-Ma\u2018ad, 2/56. \n\nI 2 ) Fiqh As-Seerah, P.140,141. \n\n\n- 188 - \n\n\n\naccept anything: neither property nor home. So he blessed his brother and \nsaid: \u201cKindly direct me to the market so that I may make my fortune with \nmy own hands.\u201d And he did prosper and got married very shortly by his \nown labour.!'] \n\nThe Helpers were extremely generous to their brethren-in-faith. Abu \nHurairah reported that they once approached the Prophet ^ \u00ab> *ui ^ with the \nrequest that their orchards of palm trees should be distributed equally \nbetween the Muslims of Madinah and their brethren from Makkah. But the \nProphet oji ^ was reluctant to put this heavy burden upon them. It \n\nwas, however, decided that the Emigrants would work in the orchards \nalongwith the Helpers and the yield would be divided equally amongst \nthem.! 2 ! \n\nSuch examples point directly to the spirit of sacrifice, altruism and \ncordiality on the part of the Helpers, and also to the feeling of appreciation, \ngratitude and self-respect that the Emigrants held dear to their hearts. They \ntook only what helped them eke a reasonable living. In short, this policy of \nmutual brotherhood was so wise and timely that many obstinate problems \nwere resolved wonderfully and reasonably. \n\n/A Charter of Islamic Alliance: \n\nJust as the Prophet (Jl., \u00ab_ui ^ had established a code of brotherhood \namongst the believers, so too he was keen on establishing friendly relations \nbetween the Muslims and non-Muslim tribes of Arabia. He established a \nsort of treaty aiming at ruling out all pre-Islamic rancour and inter-tribal \nfeuds. He was so meticulous not to leave any area in the charter that would \nallow pre-Islamic traditions to sneak in or violate the new environment he \nwanted to establish. Herein, we look over some of its provisions. \n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This is \na document from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, concerning \nEmigrants and Helpers and those who followed and strove with them. \n\n1.

All of these efforts were exerted solely to provide peace, security, \nand prosperity to all mankind at large, and to bring about a spirit of rapport \nand harmony within his region, in particular. \n\nGeographically, the closest people to Madinah were the Jews. Whilst \nharbouring evil intentions, and nursing bitter grudge, they showed not the \nleast resistance nor the slightest animosity. The Prophet decided to ratify a \ntreaty with them with clauses that provided full freedom in faith and wealth. \nHe had no intention whatsoever of following severe policies involving \nbanishment, seizure of wealth and land or hostility. \n\nThe treaty came within the context of another one of a larger framework \nrelating to inter-Muslim relationships. \n\nThe most important provisions of the treaty are the following: \n\n1. The Jews of Bani \u2018Awf are one community with the believers. The \nJews will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs. \n\n2. The Jews shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims \nfor theirs. \n\n3. If attacked by a third party, each shall come to the assistance of the \nother. \n\n4. Each party shall hold counsel with the other. Mutual relation shall be \nfounded on righteousness; sin is totally excluded. \n\n5. Neither shall commit sins to the prejudice of the other. \n\n6. The wronged party shall be aided. \n\n7. The Jews shall contribute to the cost of war so long as they are \nfighting alongside the believers. \n\n\n- 197 - \n\n\n\n8. Madinah shall remain sacred and inviolable for all that join this \ntreaty. \n\n9. Should any disagreement arise between the signatories to this treaty, \nthen AllSh, the All-High and His Messenger shall settle the dispute. \n\n10. The signatories to this treaty shall boycott Quraish commercially; \nthey shall also abstain from extending any support to them. \n\n11. Each shall contribute to defending Madinah, in case of a foreign \nattack, in its respective area. \n\n12. This treaty shall not hinder either party from seeking lawful \nrevenge.10 \n\nMadinah and its suburbs, after the ratification of this treaty, turned into a \ncoalition state, with Madinah proper as capital and Muhammad ^ \nas \u2018president\u2019; authorities lay mainly in the hand of the Muslims, and \nconsequently it was a real capital of Islam.

Safwan Invasion. In Rabi\u2018 Al-Awwal 2 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. Karz bin Jabir \nat the head of a small group of polytheists raided the pastures ofMadinah \nand looted some animals. The Prophet ^^ 411 ^ at the head of 70 men \nleft Madinah to fight the aggressors. He went in their pursuit till he \nreached a place called Safwan near Badr but could not catch up with \nthem. This invasion came to be known as the preliminary Badr Invasion. \nDuring his absence, the Prophet + entrustedZaidbinHarithah \nwith the disposition of the affairs in Madinah.

The \nProphet [L*, \u00ab*i\u00bb uii at the head of 150-200 Muslim volunteers, with 30 \n\ncamels which they rode turn by turn, set out to intercept a Quraishite \ncaravan. He reached Dhil \u2018Ushairah but the camels had left some days \nbefore. These camels were the same that he went out to intercept on their \nreturn from Syria, and were the direct reason for the break out of the \nbattle of Badr. In the process of this campaign, the Prophet ^ <*u 411 \ncontracted a non-aggression pact with Bani Madlij and their allies Bani \nDhumrah. Abu Salama bin \u2018Abd Al-Asad Al-Makhzumi was mandated \nto rule Madinah in his absence. \n\n8 . The Platoon of Nakhlah. It took place in Rajab 2 A.H., i.e. January 624 \n\nA.H. The Messenger of Allah despatched \u2018Abdullah bin Jahsh \n\nAsadi to Nakhlah at the head of 12 Emigrants with six camels. \u2018Abdullah \nwas given a letter by the Prophet ^ an but was instructed to read it \nonly after two days. He followed the instructions and discovered that he \nwas asked to go on to a place called Nakhlah s tanding between Makkah \nand At-Ta\u2019if, intercept a caravan for Quraish and collect news about their \nintentions. He disclosed the contents of the letters to his fellows who \nblindly obeyed the orders. At Nakhlah, the caravan passed carrying loads \nof raisins (dried grapes), food stuff and other commodities. Notable \npolytheists were also there such as \u2018 Amr bin Al-Hadrami, \u2018Uthman and \nNaufal, sons of 'Abdullah bin Al-Mugheerah and others... The Muslims \nheld consultations among themselves with respect to fi ghting them taking \ninto account Rajab which was a sacred month (during which, along with \nDhul Hijjja, Dhul Qa\u2018da and Muharram, war activities were suspended as \nwas the custom in Arabia then). At last they agreed to engage with them \n\n\n- 204 - \n\n\n\nin fighting. \u2018Amr bin Al-Hadrami was shot dead by an arrow, \u2018Uthman \nand Al-Hakam were captured whereas Naufal escaped. They came back \nwith the booty and the two prisoners. They set aside one-fifth of the \nbooty assigned to Allah and His Messenger, and took the rest. The \nMessenger disapproved of that act and suspended any action as regards \nthe camels and the two captives on account of the prohibited months \nalready mentioned. The polytheists, on their part, exploited this golden \nopportunity to calumniate the Muslims and accuse them of violating what \nis Divinely inviolable. This idle talk brought about a painful headache to \nMuhammad\u2019s Companions, until at last they were relieved when the \nRevelation came down giving a decisive answer and stating quite \nexplicitly that the behaviour of the polytheists in the whole process was \nmuch more heinous and far more serious than the act of the Muslims:", "start_char_idx": 391048, "end_char_idx": 394542, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d19bbcd4-711e-4bc6-8a0d-4a028155b034": {"__data__": {"id_": "d19bbcd4-711e-4bc6-8a0d-4a028155b034", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8174d28e-299d-4d36-be33-98c960236689", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "14329b5ab2ae3d185c6a3b0a3df0febc0636296ae223ca4ae886739697a44c9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e7c47b2-1b7b-4b36-99c5-7b92c12b55ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8801a571256f37357a48ccf7bde13e89321600c697f9a48650cd4ff14005a8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a1c47052e704f4e2cfdbedfc9fd03dfcb7fa09dfd0079a978071f51a90763a7c", "text": "\u201cThey ask you concerning fighting in the sacred months \n(i.e. 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the Islamic \ncalendar).

The two \nscouts stayed at Al-Hawra\u2019 for some days until Abu Sufyan, the leader of \nthe caravan, passed by them. The two men hurried back to Madinah and \nreported to the Prophet ^ u* ui ,> their findings. Great wealth amounting to \n50 thousand gold Dinars guarded by 40 men moving relatively close to \nMadinah constituted a tempting target for the Muslim military, and provided \na potentially heavy economic, political and military strike that was bound to \nshake the entire structure of the Makkan polytheists. \n\nThe Prophet ^ uji ^ immediately exhorted the Muslims to rush out \nand waylay the caravan to make up for their property and wealth they were \nforced to give up in Makkah. He did not give orders binding to everyone, \nbut rather gave them full liberty to go out or stay back, thinkin g that it \nwould be just an errand on a small scale. \n\nThe Muslim army was made up of 300-317 men, 82-86 Emigrants, 61 \nfrom Aws and 170 from Khazraj. They were not well-equipped nor \nadequately prepared. They had only two horses belonging to Az-Zubair bin \nAl-\u2018Awwam and Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad Al-Kindi, 70 camels, one for \ntwo or three men to ride alternatively. The Messenger of Allah ^ <ui \n\nhimself, \u2018Ali and Murthid bin Abi Murthid Al-Ghanawi had only one camel. \nDisposition of the affairs of Madinah was entrusted to Ibn Umm Maktum \nbut later to Abu Lubabah bin \u2018Abdul Mundhir. The general leadership was \ngiven to Mus\u2018ab bin \u2018Umair Al-Qurashi Al-\u2018Abdari, and their standard was \nwhite in colour. The little army was divided into two battalions, the \nEmigrants with a standard raised by \u2018Ali bin Abi Talib, and the Helpers \nwhose standard was in the hand of Sa\u2018d bin Mu\u2018adh. Az-Zubair bin \nAl-\u2018Awwam was appointed to the leadership of the right flank, Al-Miqdad \nbin \u2018Amr to lead the left flank, and the rear of the army was at the command \n\n\n- 210 -", "start_char_idx": 400536, "end_char_idx": 403975, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edcbc9e8-3f5e-47d4-9ba1-dde7cf99c5dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "edcbc9e8-3f5e-47d4-9ba1-dde7cf99c5dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f816a664-9191-462b-b253-9c7fd51d5357", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "43fd8233e967a8c0d89775be4d47fd521b7cb94fc431da473dcd9d50b6edfeea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "070cc015-b9b0-4373-b0ab-dd7c8fc1b1a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81d9f214b8942881888ce6d330074904762123435e31b893bad521b47836aaa4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "61a294c791df3fb3e1b6fe2d6bf04d39331ae09bb43ecfc7964b72ba8e4077ab", "text": "- 210 - \n\n\n\nof Qais bin Abi Sa\u2018sa\u2018ah. The General Commander-in-Chief was the \nProphet ,jL-j 4)i of course. \n\nThe Prophet ^ -_ui j*, at the head of his army, marched out along the \nmain road leading to Makkah. He then turned left towards Badr and when \nhe reached As-Safra\u2019, he despatched two men to scout about for the camels \nof Quraish. \n\nAbu Sufyan, on the other hand, was on the utmost alert. He had already \nbeen aware that the route he was following was attended with dangers. He \nwas also anxious to know about the movements of Muhammad ^ on \nHis scouting men submitted to him reports to the effect that the Muslims \nwere lying in ambush for his caravan. To be on the safe side, he hired \nDamdam bin \u2018Amr Al-Ghifari to communicate a message asking for help \nfrom the Quraishites. The messenger rode fast and reached Makkah in \nfrenzy. Felling himself from his camel, he stood dramatically before \nAl-Ka\u2018bah, cut off the nose and the ears of the camel, turned its saddle \nupside down, tore off his own shirt from front and behind, and cried: \u201cO \nQuraish! Your merchandise! It is with Abu Sufyan. The caravan is being \nintercepted by Muhammad fi\u2014j and his companions. I cannot say \n\nwhat would have happened to them. Help! Help!\u201d \n\nThe effect of this hue and cry was instantaneous and the news stunned \nQuraish and they immediately remembered their pride that was wounded \nwhen the Muslims had intercepted Al-Hadrami caravan. They therefore \nswiftly mustered almost all of their forces and none stayed behind except \nAbu Lahab, who delegated someone who owed him some money. They also \nmobilized some Arab tribes to contribute to the war against the Prophet \nfL-j <jji cf ju. All the clans of Quraish gave their consent except Banu \u2018Adi. \nSoon an excited throng of 1300 soldiers including 100 horsemen and 600 \nmailed soldiers with a large number of camels, was clamouring to proceed \nto fight the Muslims. For food supplies, they used to slaughter an alternate \nnumber of camels of ten and nine every day. They were however afraid that \nBanu Bakr, on account of old long deep-seated animosity, would attack \ntheir rear. At that critical moment, Iblis (Satan) appeared to them in the \nguise of Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju\u2018sham Al-Mudlaji \u2014 chief of Bani Kinana \n\u2014 saying to them: \u201cI guarantee that no harm will happen from behind.\u201d \n\n\n- 211 - \n\n\n\nThey set out burning with indignation, motivated by a horrible desire for \nrevenge and exterminating anyone that might jeopardize the routes of their \ncaravans: \n\n\n\n\nw * \u2022 boastfully and to be seen of men, and hinder (men) from the \npath of Allah. \u201d [8:47] \n\nOr as the Prophet ^ ^ <ui ^ said: \n\n\u201cO Allah these are the haughty and conceited; they have come \ndefying Allah and defying His Messenger.\u201d \n\nThey moved swiftly northward to Badr. On the way they received \nanother message from Abu Sufyan asking them to go back home because \nthe caravan had escaped the Muslims. Incidentally, Abu Sufyan, on learning \nthe intention of the Muslims, led his caravan off the main route, and \ninclined it towards the Red Sea. By this manoeuvre, he was able to slip past \nthe Madinese ambush and was out of their reach. \n\n\nOn receiving Abu Sufyan\u2019s message, the Makkan army showed a desire \nto return home. The tyrant Abu Jahl, however haughtily and arrogantly \ninsisted that they proceed to Badr, stay three nights there for making \nfestivities. Now they wanted to punish the Muslims and prevent them from \nintercepting their caravans, and impress on the Arabs that Quraish still had \nthe upper hand and enjoyed supremacy in that area. \n\nAbu Jahl\u2019s threats and insistence notwithstanding, Banu Zahrah, acting \non the advice of Al-Akhnas bin Shuraiq, broke away and returned to \nMakkah. Thenceforth Al-Akhnas remained \u2018the well-rubbed palm tree\u2019 for \nBam Zahrah and was blindly obeyed in all relevant matters. \n\nBanu Hashim were also inclined to break away, but Abu Jahl\u2019s threats \nmade them desist from that idea.", "start_char_idx": 403968, "end_char_idx": 407917, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "070cc015-b9b0-4373-b0ab-dd7c8fc1b1a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "070cc015-b9b0-4373-b0ab-dd7c8fc1b1a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "edcbc9e8-3f5e-47d4-9ba1-dde7cf99c5dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "61a294c791df3fb3e1b6fe2d6bf04d39331ae09bb43ecfc7964b72ba8e4077ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "55aad1f4-fbea-46a3-b43b-40a4bc727dd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "954fce770ce03fb10514f6d23057653f1a47ba7be5de62d565947c5e16f60e74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "81d9f214b8942881888ce6d330074904762123435e31b893bad521b47836aaa4", "text": "The rest of the army, now 1000 soldiers, approached Badr and encamped \nthemselves beyond a sand dune at Al- lldwat Al-Quswa. \n\n\u2018The intelligence corps\u2019 of the Madinese army reported to the Prophet \n(J \u2014.y that a bloody encounter with die Makkans was inescapable, and \n\nthat a daring step in this context had to be taken, or else the forces of evil \n\n\n- 212 - \n\n\n\nwould violate the inviolable and would consequently manage to undermine \nthe noble cause of the Islam and tread upon its faithful adherents.

A few of them approached, in a \nprovocative deed, to draw water from the wells of Badr, but were all shot \ndead except one. Hakeem bin Hizam, who later became a devoted Muslim. \n\u2018Umair bin Wahab Al-Jumahi, in an attempt to reconnoiter the power of the \nMuslims, made a scouting errand and submitted a report saying that the \nMuslim army numbered as many as 300 men keen on fighting to the last \nman. On another reconnaissance mission he came to the conclusion that \nneither reinforcements were coming nor ambushes laid. He understood that \n\n\n- 216 - \n\n\n\nthey were too brave to surrender and too intent on carrying out their military \nduties to withdraw without slaying the largest number possible of the \npolytheists. This report as well as kindred relations binding the two \nbelligerent parties together, slackened the desire to fight among some of the \nQuraishites. To counteract this reason-based opposition advocated by a rival \nof his, \u2018Utbah bin Rabi\u2018a and others, Abu Jahl started an anti-campaign \nseeking vengeance on Muhammad ,j\u2014, ^ <_ui j_l>\u2019s followers for the \nQuraishites killed at Nakhlah. In this way, he managed to thwart the \nopposite orientation, and manipulated the people to see his evil views only. \n\nWhen the two parties approached closer and were visible to each other, \nthe Prophet began supplicating Allah \u201cO Allah! The conceited \n\nand haughty Quraishites are already here defying You and belying Your \nMessenger. O Allah! I am waiting for Your victory which You have \npromised me. I beseech You Allah to defeat them (the enemies).\u201d He also \ngave strict orders that his men would not start fighting until he gave them \nhis final word. He recommended that they use their arrows sparingly! 1 ! and \nnever resort to sword unless the enemies came too close.! 2 ! \n\nAbu Jahl also prayed for victory, saying: \u201cOur Lord, whichever of the \ntwo parties was less kind to his relatives, and brought us what we do not \nknow, then destroy him tomorrow.\u201d.

He stepped out swearing he would drink from the water basin of \nthe Muslims, otherwise, destroy it or die for it. He engaged with Hamzah \nbin \u2018Abdul Muttalib, who struck his leg with his sword and dealt him \nanother blow that finished him off inside the basin. \n\n\nThe battle had actually started. Protected by armour and shields, \u2018Utbah \nbin Rabi\u2018a stepped forth between his brother Shaibah and his son Al-Waleed \nbin \u2018Utbah from the lines of Quraish and hurled maledictions at the \nMuslims. Three young men of the Helpers came out against them: \u2018Awf and \nMu\u2018wwadh \u2014 the sons of Harith, and \u2018Abdullah bin Rawaha. But the \nMakkans yelled that they had nothing to do with them. They wanted the \nheads of their cousins. Upon this the Prophet ^ <*u *ui ^ asked \u2018Ubaidah bin \nAl-Harith, Hamzah \u2014 his uncle, and his cousin \u2018Ali ^ to go forward \nfor the combat. The three duels were rapid. Hamzah killed Shaibah, while \n\u2018Ali killed Al-WaleedJ 1 ) \u2018Ubaidah was seriously wounded but, before he \nfell, Hamzah fell upon \u2018Utbah and with a sweep of his sword, cut off his \nhead. \u2018Ali and Hamzah carried\u2018Ubaidah back with his leg cut off. He died \nfour or five days later of a disease in the bile duct. \n\n\n\u2018Ali was \nrevealed: \n\n\npossessed of a deep conviction that Allah\u2019s Words were \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThese two opponents (believers and disbelievers) dispute with \neach other about their Lord.\u201d [22:19] \n\nThese verses were revealed in connection with men of Faith who confess \ntheir Lord and seek to carry out His Will (i.e. Muhammad ^ \nfollowers at Badr Battle), and men who deny their Lord and defy Him (the \npeople of Quraish). \n\nThe duel was followed by a tew more duels but the Makkans suffered \nterrible defeats in all the combats and lost some of their most precious lives. \nThey were too much exasperated and enraged and fell upon the Muslims to \n\n\nI'l Mishkat, 2/343. \n\n\n\nexterminate them once and for all. The Muslims, however, after suppli cating \ntheir Lord, calling upon Him for assistance, were made to hold to their \nposition and conduct a defensive war plan that was successful enough to \ninflict heavy losses on the attackers. The Prophet ^ <i>i^ used to pray to \nhis Lord ceaselessly persistently and day and night to come to their succour. \nWhen the fierce engagement grew too hot he again began to supplicate his \nLord saying: \n\n\n\nol |11 1 pjl aAmmJI \u00bbJut kiligj Ol ^JLlU \n\nilJbt (.^jl \n\n\n\u201cO Allah!

With respect to this, Allah says: \n\n\u201cAnd you (i.e. Muhammad ^ *jji ^l.) threw not when you did \nthrow but Allah threw.\u201d [8:17] \n\n\nOnly then did he give clear orders to launch a counter-attack.

Unique deeds \nof valour, deep devotion and full obedience to the Prophet ^ ^ <ui ^ were \nexhibited in the process of the battle. The army of the faithfuls was borne \n\n\n- 221 - \n\n\n\nforward by the power of enthusiasm which the half-hearted warriors of \nMakkah miserably lacked. A large number of the polytheists were killed and \nthe others began to waver. No wonder! The standard-bearers of Truth were \ngiven immediate help, and supernatural agencies (the angels), were sent to \ntheir assistance by their Lord to help them defeat the forces of evil. \n\nThe records of Hadith speak eloquently of the fact that the angels did \nappear on that day and fought on the side of the Muslims.

One of them spoke in a secret voice asking me to show him Abu Jahl. I \nasked about his intention, to which he replied, that he had a strong desire to \nengage with him in a combat until either of them was killed. It was \nsomething incredible to me. I turned left and the other said something to the \nsame effect and showed a similar desire. I acceded to their earnest pleas and \npointed directly at their target. They both rushed swiftly towards the spot, \nand without a moment\u2019s hesitation struck him simultaneously with their \nswords and finished him off. They went back to the Messenger of Allah \n^ *ui jL., each claiming that he had killed Abu Jahl to the exclusion of the \nother. The Prophet ^ uii ^ju asked if they had wiped the blood off their \n\nswords and they answered that they had not. He then examined both swords \nand assured them that they both had killed him.

Bilal, the \nProphet (Jl.* uii ^\u2019s caller for prayer, saw Omaiyah and soon all the \ntorture he had been put to at the hand of this man dawned upon him, and \nswore he would have revenge on Omaiyah. \u2018Abdur-Rahman tried to ease \nthe tension and address embarrassing situation amicably but with no \nsuccess.

Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith gave Abu \nLahab a full account of the massacre and the disgraceful rout they sustained, \nwith emphasis on the role that the angels played in bringing about their \ntragic end. Abu Lahab could not contain himself and gave vent to his \nfeelings of resentment in beating, abusing and slapping Abu Rafi\u2018, a \nMuslim, but reticent on his conversion, for reiterating the role of the angels. \nUmm Al-Fadl, another Muslim woman, greatly exasperated by Abu Lahab\u2019s \nthoughtless behaviour, struck him with a log and cracked his head. Seven \ndays later, he died of an ominous ulcer and was left for three days unburied. \nHis sons, however, for fear of shameful rumours, drove him to a pit and \nkeeping their distance, hurled stones and dust at him. \n\n\n- 227 -", "start_char_idx": 435136, "end_char_idx": 437123, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "083c9e91-87ff-4e58-8e81-98245b253c08": {"__data__": {"id_": "083c9e91-87ff-4e58-8e81-98245b253c08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "856e4246-603d-4bf3-bf06-c52690c42cf6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "6a827220e4960c112eb2c7d3e74ae2d578d8b8130284eaa712599b07d8b09c0f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "356e83fc-57f1-4853-9def-cab3062c3d2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9979b362353316bf4853160d1d1410fd510d95dc30364ae2d03e384686a3d444", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "46cac00fc708fb9ab61d923f72c17f5ba364137367b68a0638ecfaff67c1fa53", "text": "- 227 - \n\n\n\nThe defeat was a matter of great shame and grief for the Makkans.

Allah \nwanted the Muslims to follow war ethics dissimilar to those of pre-Islamic \npractices. The Muslims are deemed to outdo the others in ethics, values and \nfine ideals. He wants to impress on the world that Islam is not merely a \ntheoretical code of life, it is rather mind cultivation-orientated practical \nprinciples. In this context.

He perceived a \nprevalent spirit of reconciliation and an atmosphere of rapport and amity \nenveloping the whole group; an unusual scene categorically in conflict with \nthe animosity and hatred that characterized their pre-Islam behaviour. He, \ntherefore, sent a youth of his to sit among them, remind them of Bu\u2018ath war \nbetween them and recite some of their verses which they used to compose \nsatirizing each other; all of this with the intention of sowing die seeds of \ndiscord and disagreement and undermining the new Islamically-orientated \ninter-tribal relations.

As for \u2018the armour\u2019 it was Madinah. Then he offered a \nsuggestion that his Companions should not go out ofMadinah and that they \nshould encamp themselves within the city. He was of the opinion that the \nenemies should be left in the open to exhaust themselves and thus the \nMuslims would not risk a battle.

The \nformer proved to be skillful at shooting arrows; the latter wrestled the \nformer and beat him. The admission of Rafi\u2018 made Samura say: \u201cI am \nstronger than him, I can overcome him.\u201d When the Prophet ^ ju heard \nthis saying he ordered them to wrestle. They did. Samura won so he was \nalso admitted. \n\nPassing the Night between Uhud and Madinah: \n\nAs night fell upon them there, they performed both the sunset and the \nevening prayers and spent the night there as well. Fifty people were chosen \nto guard the camp and go round it Muhammad bin Maslama Al-Ansari, the \nhero of the brigade of Ka\u2018b bin Al-Ashraf, was in charge of the guards. \nWhereas Dhakwan bin \u2018Abd Qais undertook the responsibility of guarding \nthe Prophet ^ <i\u00bb in particular. \n\nThe Rebellion of \u2018Abdullah bin Ubai and his Followers: \n\nAt the end of the night and just before it was daybreak, the Prophet \nft-, \u00abui moved and when he got to Ash-Shawt he observed the dawn prayer. \nThere he was close enough to the enemy that they could see one another. It \nwas there that \u2018Abdullah bin Ubai \u2014 the hypocrite \u2014 rebelled against the \nMuslims. One-third of the army withdrew with him \u2014 that is to say three \nhundred fighters. He said, \u201cWe do not know why we shall kill ourselves.\u201d \nHe claimed that his withdrawal was no more than showing protest against \nthe Messenger of Allah ^ ^ who had already refused his opinion and \naccepted that of the others. \n\nUndoubtedly that was not the real cause of his detachment. If it had been \nthe refusal of his opinion \u2014 as the hypocrite claimed \u2014 there would have \nno sense whatsoever for his joining the Prophetic army. If it had been so, he \nwould have refused to go out with the army from the very beginning of the \nmarch. As a matter of fact the real purpose of this rebellion, withdrawal and \ndetachment \u2014 at this delicate and awkward position and time \u2014 was to \nproduce bewilderment, confusion of mind, and disorder in the Muslims \narmy who were within the sight and hear range of the enemy who were also \n\n\n- 250 - \n\n\n\nlooking forward to seeing more and more dissension on the side of the \nMuslims, like themselves. They also aimed at breaking the high morale of \nthe believers. That would accelerate \u2014 in their opinion \u2014 the breakdown \nand consequently the death of Muhammad, his faithful Companions and \nIslam as a whole. The way would then be clear for the reclaim of \npresidency, which that hypocrite had lost on the advent of Islam into \nMadinah. \n\nShort of Allah\u2019s Care, the hypocrite\u2019s plot would have been successful. \nBanu Haritha of Al-Aws and Banu Salama of Al-Khazraj were partially \nimpressed by the hypocrite\u2019s behaviour. Both of them were overwhelmed by \nconfusion and they had almost started to withdraw, but Allah\u2019s Care saved \nthem from that disgrace. About their incident Allah says: \n\n\n\n\u201cWhen two parties from among you were about to lose their \nheart, but Allah was their Wall (Supporter and Protector).

The Messenger of Allah ^ 411 selected the top \n\nand the most courageous group to be in the vanguard of the army. They \nwere notable for their readiness, alertness and bravery and estimated to be \nequal to thousands of men. \n\nIt was a wise and carefully-laid plan which revealed the genius of \nmilitary leadership that the Prophet ^ 411 possessed. No other leader \n\ncould have drawn a more accurate or wise plan. Although he approached the \nsite later than the enemy, he managed to occupy better positions. He made \nthe rocky mountainside to function as shield for the army\u2019s rear and right \nflank. He was able, by blocking the only vulnerable gap on the side, to, \nprovide additional maximum protection for the rear as well as the left wing. \nFor fear of possible defeat, and to deter the Muslims from fleeing, in which \ncase they would fall easy prisoners in the hands of the enemy, he chose a \nhigh place for encampment. Moreover a strategic site of this sort would \nsurely inflict heavy losses on the polytheists if they thought of approaching \nor occupying his positions. In a further step, he reduced the enemy to a \nnarrow scope of choice when they were cornered for encampment in \ngeographically low positions that would avail them nothing of the benefits \nof any possible victory; at the same time they would not be able to escape \nthe pursuit of the Muslims in case victory sided with the latter. To make up \nfor the quantitative shortage in fighting personnel, he chose a picked body \nof fighters to stand at the front. \n\nThe army of the Prophet ^ \u00ab\u00abu 411 ^ was thus fully mobilized on Shawwal \n7th, 3 A.H. \n\nThe Messenger of Allah implants the Spirit of Bravery \n\namong his Armed Forces: \n\nThe Messenger of Allah ^ \u00abui forbade the Muslims to start the fight \nwithout having an order from him. He, then, wore two armours \u2014 a front \narmour and a back one. He urged his Companions to fight and spurred them \nto show stamina and steadfastness at fight. He started to implant the spirit of \nboldness and bravery in them. To wage and inflame his Companions and in \norder to standfast in the fight, he took a sharp sword, held it in his hand and \ncalled out unto his Companions and said: \u201cWho is ready to take this sword \nand give it its proper due?\u201d Many a man set out to take it.

Addressing him, they said: \u201cYou want us to deliver \nyou the custodianship of the standard? Tomorrow when we fight them, you \nwill witness our deeds.\u201d As a matter of fact, they fought bravely and \nstoodfast in defence of the standard till they were all killed. \n\nPolitical Manoeuvres of Quraish: \n\nA little time before the break out of the battle, Quraish made some \nendeavours to sow the seeds of discord and dispute among the Muslims. \nFirst, Abu Sufyan sent to the Helpers a message saying: \u201cLeave us alone to \nfight our cousins and do not interfere. If you stand aside, we will not fight \nyou; for fighting you is not a target of ours.\u201d But that attempt proved to be \nfruitless. What could such a wicked scheme do to those whose Faith was as \nsolid and firm as mountains?! The Helpers reply was undoubtedly \ndisappointing and contrary to Abu Sufyan\u2019s expectations. \n\nThe zero-hour was due. The two parties drew nearer. Undespaired by the \nfirst failure, Quraish made another attempt, for the same purport but now \nwith the assistance of a traitor called Abu \u2018Amir Al-Fasiq, whose name was \n\u2018Abd \u2018Amr bin Saifi. He was called a monk, but the Messenger of All&h \n\n4 *u 4_ui nicknamed him Al-Fasiq (i.e. perverted transgressor; dissolute). \nAs he was the head of Aws in Al-Jahiliya, he could not tolerate Islam when \nit came. He announced his enmity to the Messenger of All&h ^ ^ in \n\npublic. He left Madinah for the Quraishites in Makkah to rally them against \nthe Messenger of Allah and to urge them to start the fight against \n\nhim. He claimed that he was obeyed and esteemed by his people and that as \nsoon as they saw him come they would join him immediately. \n\nSo he was the first one among the mob and slaves of Quraish to show \nresistance. He called out unto his people, recognized them and said: \u201cO \nkinfolk of Aws! I am Abu \u2018Amir.\u201d Their reply was \u201cNo eyes of anybody \nshall be consoled by viewing you, O Fasiq.\u201d Hearing them say so, he said: \n\u201cMy people must have been afflicted by an evil after my departure.\u201d \nTherefore when the fight broke out, he fought them fiercely and pelted his \npeople with stones, as well. \n\n\n- 256 -", "start_char_idx": 497027, "end_char_idx": 499338, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9e361af-d7b8-4a0f-b197-967367f54715": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9e361af-d7b8-4a0f-b197-967367f54715", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eeb0ced4-6280-409d-99c2-2bb70bacebf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "c18962946ea888a6cb9d793c7def1e122afbeaf7a88e3872a5179b777c0b6988", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "34e7e588-48be-4674-826b-a0ce2d5e8c41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "99e71b86ed88a0754f400473f2b4411a6ab97696c3c20f8f5cec879cd6bc3583", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "98012ea75103ef3665e84165435f4739315f63848b164e5ebc06ebef08ca439d", "text": "- 256 - \n\n\n\nThat was how the second attempt of Quraish to sow the seeds of discord \namong people of Faith.

Then \u2018Ali gave him a terminal blow that \nfinished him off. \n\nMusafi\u2018 bin Talha bin Abi Talha then hoisted the standard, but was soon \nshot with an arrow by \u2018Asim bin Thabit bin Abi Al-Aqlah. His brother Kilab \nbin Talha bin Abi Talha followed him picked the banner and lifted it up; but \nAz-Zubair bin Al-\u2018Awwam attacked him and managed to kill him.

They also said that it was \u2018Asim bin \nThabit who managed to deal a terminal blow to him. \n\nAll those six people killed round and in defence of the standard, \nbelonged to one house, the house of Abi Talha \u2018Abdullah bin \u2018Uthman bin \n\u2018Abd Ad-Dar.

It has for long \nbeen discussed by scholars and men of research. Was it a defeat or not? \nDoubtlessly, the military superiority in the second phase of the battle was in \nfavour of the polytheists who could successfully direct the steering \nmechanism of hostilities and inflict heavy losses in lives on the Muslims. \nAdmittedly, a part of the believers were clearly defeated, but this could \nnever be considered a Makkan victory. \n\nThe Makkan army failed to occupy the camp of the Muslims. The greater \nbulk of the Madinese army, chaos and confusion notwi thstanding, did not \ntake to escape, on the contrary they showed matchless and heroic resistance \nand managed to gather themselves again around their headquarters fighting \nbravely and courageously. They, moreover, did not allow the Makkans to \nrun after them in pursuit. Neither Muslim captives were taken nor spoils \nwere gained by the Makkans. The enemies of Islam were also too cowardly \nto conduct the third phase of war, and impress their superiority on the \nbattlefield, on the contrary, they were in hot haste to evacuate the field even \nbefore the Muslims did. Madinah itself, the capital of the Muslims, was only \na stone\u2019s throw from the lines of the enemy, and vulnerably exposed, yet the \npolytheists were not bold enough to storm it to plunder its wealth or capture \nthe Muslim women therein. \n\nThese suggestive details in fact support our argument that the event of \nUhud was just a precious occasion on which the Makkans managed only to \ninflict heavy losses on the Muslims but failed to achieve their ultimate goals \nof annihilating the Muslim army in the process of their encompassment \noperation. After all, it is not unusual for conquerors to sustain such \ncasualties and losses, but these could under no circumstances be regarded as \nvictory for the hostile party. \n\n\nt>) Ibn Hisham, 2/60-129; Zfid Al-Ma\u2018ad, 2/91-108; Fath Al-Bari, 7/345-377; \nMukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool, pp. 242-275. \n\n\n- 292 - \n\n\n\nThe incident of Hamr&\u2019 Al-Asad is interesting in this regard. It is a \ncurious sight indeed of a victorious army in retreat for fear of disgrace and \ndefeat, and the crestfallen and crippled group of Muslims in pursuit. \n\nUhud Battle in the final judgement was just one phase of military \nactivities in the whole process of war between two hostile parties each of \nwhom earned their legitimate portion of both success and failure and then \ndesisted further engagement but without cowardly escape or resigned \nsurrender. In this sense, this battle could be rightly regarded as an \ninseparable war. \n\nIn this context, Allah says: \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t be weak in die pursuit of die enemy; if you are \nsuffering (hardships) then surely, they (too) are suffering \n(hardships) as you are suffering, but you have a hope from Allah \n(for the reward, i.e. Paradise) that for which they hope not\u201d \n[ 4 : 104 ] \n\n\nThe verse explicidy identifies both attitudes as regards losses and \nhardships as identical.

Sixty verses relevant to the battle were revealed giving full \naccount of the first phase of the battle: \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd (remember) when you (Muhammad left your \n\nhousehold in the morning to post the believers at their stations \nfor the battle (of Uhud).\u201d [3:121] \n\n\nAnd to end in a comprehensive commentary on its results and moralities: \n\n\n\n\n\u201cAllah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are \nnow, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will \nAllah disclose to you the secrets of the Ghaib (unseen), but \nAllah chooses of His Messengers whom He pleases. So believe \nin Allah and His Messengers. And if you believe and fear Allah, \nthen for you there is a great reward.\u201d [3:179] \n\n\nLessons and Moralities: \n\nIbn Al-Qaiyim has made a pointed reference to the battle of Uhud and \ngiven full elucidation of the Divine benefits and moralities that resulted \nfrom it. Some Muslim scholars, on the authority oflbnHajar, said: The \nreverse in Uhud resulted from the neglect on the part of the archers of the \nexplicit command of the Prophet ^ <jui j *., and leaving the spot which \nthey were ordered to safeguard to the end. In other words, the success of the \nMus lims depends upon their obedience to the Prophet ^ \u00abw j-. As long \nas they carry out his behests, Allah will help them in facing all kinds of \n\n\n- 294 - \n\n\n\nodds. But when they will set aside his commands in their pursuit of worldly \nriches, they are bound to come to grief. Another relevant issue of great \nsignificance says that it is customary for Prophets to be tried with different \nadversities; nevertheless, the fina l outcome is positively in their favour. \nShould the Muslims be victorious all the time, great many pretenders to \nFaith will enter the fold of Islam, and consequently the clear line of \ndemarcation between true believers and hypocrites will become blurred. \nContrarily, if the Muslims were to be defeated all the time, the final \nobjective of the ministry of Prophets will not be effected. It is wise then to \ncombine both success and failure so that sifting between true Muslims and \nhypocrites could be realized. \n\nIn the aftermath of the battle of Uhud, the hypocrites disclosed their real \nintentions in words and in deeds, consequently, the Muslims got to realize \nthe existence of those wicked elements working secretly in their own \nhomeland; and of course there would be appropriate measures to be taken in \ndue course of time. \n\nA third point in this context refers to purposeful deferment of victory in \nsome areas in order to check the pride of the soul and teach the believers \nhow to observe full patience in times of adversity. Trials and tests are \nprovided by Allah in order that the true believers could deservedly occupy \ntheir abode in the blessed Hereafter. Martyrdom, the highest ranks that the \ntrue friends of Allah could occupy, is provided by Allah to function as a \npassport, granted by the Lord, leading to Paradise. In brief, fight in the \ncause of Allah is a golden opportunity for the true believers to have their \nsins effaced, and a Divinely-devised event for the disbelievers and enemies \nof Allah to face destruction and annihilation in recompense for their \ndisbelief, tyranny and transgression! 1 )", "start_char_idx": 573942, "end_char_idx": 578313, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5ccbb1b-dbae-465e-9c43-e3c45b2e4d5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5ccbb1b-dbae-465e-9c43-e3c45b2e4d5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "18136643-e756-4da8-be34-81af21bd2e93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "5a3391f2950d79c29f3a9c46250aa4df3c11d6279c9082a434803c6d4d7942a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f82fa33f-8392-4d86-b300-f7da2d6e27a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "96ee001d99ee957f8d70dceffc145f1604711dd0116a8f3169aa09e01fb46a29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6cc9eaf9f33fdf2b4e0afcbbdbb307f7b06a3c9833e2ac9ba02834cbe2b066ae", "text": "(>] Zad Al-Ma\u2018ad, 2/99-108. \n\n\n- 295 - \n\n\n\nMilitary Platoons and Missions between the Battle of Uhud \nand die Battle of the Confederates \n\nUhud\u2019s misfortune left a bad impact on both the credibility and military \nreputation of the Muslims.

Troubles and dangers spread everywhere in and out of Madinah. \nThe Jews, hypocrites and bedouins declared publicly their enmity to the \nMuslims and each party was keen on degrading and, in the final place, \nexterminating their whole existence. \n\nTwo months had almost passed after this battle, when Banu Asad made \npreparations to raid M a dinah, \u2018Udal and Qarah tribes conspired against \nthe Muslims in the month of Safer, 4 A.H. and killed ten of the Prophet \nfi-j uii j-u\u2019s Companions.

Launching a \nwar against their opponents at this critical stage could entail terrible far \nreaching ramifications in the light of the unfavourable conditions they were \npassing through, besides the hostile environment growing in power and \nhatred around them, the harbinger of which assumed the form of killing the \nMuslim missions, as it has been already introduced. \n\n\nThe Jews of Bani Nadeer were also a power to count for, and the \nprospects of inflicting a military defeat on them was precarious; \nconsequently forcing them into war engagement would be attended with \nunpredictable risks. On the other hand, the continual state of repeated \nassassinations and acts of treachery carried out against the Muslims \nindividually and collectively brought about unbearable headache to \nMuhammad ^ uii ^ju\u2019s followers. Having judged all the prevalent status \nquo in this perspective, and in the light of the disgraceful attempt on the life \nof the Prophet ^ uii the Muslims made the decisive decisions of \ntaking up arms whatever turn the consequences could assume. \n\nWhen the Messenger of Allah ^ \u00bb*u \u00abdi received the reply of Huyai bin \nAkhtab he said: \u201cAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.\" (Allah is the Greatest of all) \nand his Companions repeated after him. Then he set out to fight them after \nappointing Ibn Umm Maktum to dispose the affairs of Madinah during his \nabsence. The standard was entrusted to \u2018Ali bin Abi Talib. He laid siege to \ntheir forts for six nights \u2014 in another version, fifteen. \n\ns' Banu Nadeer resorted to their castles, mounted them and started shooting \n'arrows and pelting stones at the Muslims enjoying the strategic advantage \nthat their thick fields of palm trees provided.

Consequently the Prophet pi-, an jl, had ample time to direct all \nhis energies and human resources towards suppressing the desert bedouins \nand curbing their harmful provocations and wicked malicious practices of \nkilling his missionaries and even contemplating an invasion of Madinah \nitself.! 2 ! Meanwhile, the Muslim scouting groups reported building up of \nbedouin troops of Bani Muharib and Tha\u2018labah of Ghatfan around Madinah. \nThe Prophet ^ uii with the Muslims, hurriedly set out to discipline \nthose new outlaws, cast fear into their hearts and deter them from \nperpetrating further wicked practices. These deterring operations were \ncarried out repeatedly and did produce effective results. The rebellious hard\u00ac \nhearted desert bedouins were terrorized into the mountains, and Madinah \nremained completely immune against their raids. \n\nIn the context of these invasions, it is interesting to draw some \nprominence to a significant one \u2014Dhat Ar-Riqa * (rags) campaign \u2014-which \nsome scholars claim, took place in Najd (a large area of tableland in the \nArabian Peninsula) in Rabi\u2018 Ath-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula, 4 A.H.

The hypocrites were silenced, a tribe of the Jews \nevacuated while the other continued to fake good neighbourliness and \nseemingly faithful adherence to the covenants, the desert bedouins subdued \nand finally the archenemy Quraish no longer keen on attacking the Muslims. \nThis secure strategic attitude created optimum circumstances for the \nMuslims to resume their logical course in propagating Islam and \ncommunicating the Messages of the Lord to all worlds. \n\n\n- 308 - \n\n\n\nBanu Abs Banu Kalb \nDamra and Diyan \u25a0' \n\n\n\n309 \n\n\nArab tribes in the lifetime \n\nof Prophet 2H \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Ahzab (the Confederates) Invasion", "start_char_idx": 602807, "end_char_idx": 606302, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81404d1c-5e6d-4041-95ff-933236adf948": {"__data__": {"id_": "81404d1c-5e6d-4041-95ff-933236adf948", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c27ec197-b30f-4bfa-b9a0-9ef28ae53f7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "c1c9a2a0c2bc3b09e401f4847850624492f8dec2392b3f67043c26ef9fd4f637", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c6357e0-131f-45aa-a423-8ccdec9b61a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7cac52ac082c48e4336e31ee019a77b291d2ffe722c95d88559a0791edaf3b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4208d209c17e63367ce615ef774e2b547ace6d7a05b5fd80bd58c3ba4c3a0302", "text": "- 308 - \n\n\n\nBanu Abs Banu Kalb \nDamra and Diyan \u25a0' \n\n\n\n309 \n\n\nArab tribes in the lifetime \n\nof Prophet 2H \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Ahzab (the Confederates) Invasion \n\n\nOnce again, peace and security enveloped the Arabian Peninsula and this \nturbulent area began to experience a period of lull after a whole year war. \nThe Jews, however, whose treachery, intrigues and disloyalty made them \ntaste all types of humiliation and disgrace, were not admonished.

The Muslims, with the Prophet an ./.at their head, \nencouraging, helping and reminding them of the reward in the Hereafter, \nmost actively and diligently started to build a trench around Madinah. \nSevere hunger, bordering on starvation, could not dissuade or discourage \nthem from achieving their desperately sought objective. Salman said: O \nMessenger of AllSh! When siege was to laid to us in Persia, we used to dig \ntrenches to defend ourselves. It was really an unprecedented wise plan. The \nMessenger of Allah hurriedly gave orders to implement the plan. \n\nForty yards was allocated to each group of ten to dig. Sahl bin Sa\u2018d said: \nWe were in the company of the Messenger of Allah ^ j*, the men \n\nused to dig and we evacuate the earth on our backs. \n\nSome preternatural Prophetic signs appeared in the process of trenching. \nJabir bin \u2018Abdullah, seeing the Prophet ^ <jii ^ starving, slaughtered a \n\nsheep, cooked some barley and requested the Prophet and some \n\nCompanions to accept his invitation, but the Prophet (L., gathered all \n\nthe thousand people engaged in digging the trench and they started to eat \nuntil they were all completely full and yet the shoulder of mutton and dough \nthat was being baked remained as they were undiminished. A certain \nwoman brought a handful of dates and passed by the Prophet ^ *u <w j*, \nwho took the dates, threw them over his cloak and invited his followers to \neat. The dates began to increase in number until they dropped over the trim \nof his robe. Another illustrious preternatural example went to the effect that \nan obstinate rock stood out as an immu ne obstacle in the ditch. The \nProphet \u00abjii jO- took the spade and struck, and the rock immediately \n\nturned into a loose sand dune. In another version, Al-Bara\u2018 said: On \nAl-Khandaq (the trench) Day there stood out a rock too immune for our \nspades to break up. We therefore went to see the Messenger of All\u00a7h \n\u00abui ju, for advice. He took the spade, and struck the rock uttering \u201cin the \nName of Allah, Allah is Great, the keys of Ash-Sham (Geographical Syria) \nare mine, I swear by Allah, I can see its palaces at the moment;\u201d on the \nsecond strike he said: \u201cAllah is Great, Persia is mine, I swear by Allah, I can \nnow see the white palace of Madain;\u201d and for the third time he struck the \nrock, which turned into very small pieces, he said: \u201cAllah is Great, I have \nbeen given the keys of Yemen, I swear by Allah, I can see die gates of San'a \n\n\n- 312 - \n\n\n\nwhile I am in my place\u201d The same version was narrated by Ishaq.!\u2019!

The different narrations point to the fact that the situation lasted \nfor a few days.Pl \n\nIt is clear that, and because of the trench standing between the two \nparties, no direct engagement took place, but rather there were military \nactivities confined to arrow hurling, consequently the fight claimed the lives \nof a small number of fighters, six Muslims and ten polytheists, one or two \nkilled by sword. \n\nDuring the process of fighting, Sa\u2018d bin Mu\u2018adh was shot by an arrow \nthat pierced his artery.

He, moreover, promised to stay in Ka\u2018b\u2019s fort \nexposing himself to any potential danger in case Quraish and Ghatfan \nrecanted. The wicked man went on in this manner until he later managed to \nwin Ka\u2018b to his side and persuade him to break his covenant with the \nMuslims.! 2 ) Banu Quraiza then started to launch war operations against the \nMuslims especially the secluded garrisons that housed the women and \nchildren of the Muslims.

Safiyah said: \u201cA Jew was \nspotted lurking around our site, which was vulnerable to any enemy attacks \nbecause there were no men to defend it.

Hassan answered \nthat he would not do it, so I took a bar of wood, went down and struck the \nJew to death. I returned and asked Hassan to loot him but again Hassan \nrefused to do that.! 3 ) This event had a far reaching effect and discouraged the \nJews from conducting further attacks thinking that those sites were fortified \nand protected by Muslim fighters.

It headed for the habitation of \nBani Bakr sept. The Muslims attacked that sept and dispersed them in all \ndirections. Plenty of spoils fell to the lot of the Muslims who returned home \nwith a terrible disbeliever, Thumamah bin Uthal Al-Hanafi, chief of Bani \nHanifa, who had gone out by order of Musailama, the Liarf'l, to assassinate \nthe Prophet (L. } an j*.. The Prophet\u2019s Companions tied him to a pole of the \n\nProphetic Mosque. To a question posed by the Prophet ^ \u00abjui \u201eju, \nThumamah used to say: \u201cIf you were to kill someone, then you would have \nto choose one of noble descent, if you were to be gracious, then let it be to a \ngrateful man and if you were to ask for money, you would have to ask for it \nfrom a generous man.\u201d He repeated that three times on three different \noccasions. On the third time, the Prophet ^ <ui ordered that he should \nbe released. He soon went nearby, washed and then came back to profess \nthe new faith addressing the Prophet ^ ^ an \u201cNo face had been more \nawful to me than yours but now it is the closest to my heart, no religion had \never been more repugnant to me than yours, now it is the dearest in my \nheart. Now I want to perform the \u2018Umrah (lesser pilgrimage).\u201d The Prophet \ngave him good tidings and asked him to do that. On his arrival in \nMakkah, the Quraishites accused him of apostasy. He denied it and affirmed \nthat he had embraced Islam, and then swore that they would never get a \ngrain from Yamama, a suburban area around Makkah, unless the Prophet \nfL-j \u00abjji would allow it.

However, when the \npower of the allied Confederates collapsed and they began to slacken and \nresign to the current unfavourable balance of power, the Messenger of Allah \nfL-j ^ seized this rare opportunity and decided that it was time to take \nrevenge on Bani Lihyan. He set out in Rabi\u2018 Al-Awwal or Jumada Al-Ula in \nthe year six Hijri at the head of two hundred Muslim fighters and made a \nfeint of heading for Syria, then soon changed route towards Batn Gharran, \nthe scene of his Companions\u2019 tragedy, and invoked Allah\u2019s mercy on them. \nNews of his march reached Bani Libyan, who immediately fled to the \nmountain tops nearby and thus remained out of his reach. On his way back, \nthe Prophet ^<><11^ despatched a group of ten horsemen to a place called \nKura* Al-Ghamim, in the vicinity of the habitation of Quraish in order to \nindirectly confirm his growing military power. All these skirmishes took \nfourteen days, after which he left back for home. \n\nExpeditions and Delegations continued: \n\n1. A platoon led by \u2018Ukasha bin Al-Mihsan was despatched to a place \ncalled Al-Ghamir inhabited by Bani Asad in the year six Hijri.

Safwan bin Mu\u2018attal, an Emigrant who was \ncoming in the rear recognized her as he had seen her before the verse \nenjoining the veil was revealed, and brought her on his camel to Madinah \nwithout saying a single word to her, himself walking behind the animal.

It is noteworthy that all the foregone invasions did not imply real \nbitter fighting, they were rather skirmishes or punitive military \nmanoeuvres carried out to deter some enemies still unsubdued. Deep \nmeditation on the development of war circumstances reveal the \ncontinuous collapse of the morale among the enemies of Islam, who had \ncome to understand that they were no longer in a position to contain the \nIslamic call or weaken its active drive. This state of affairs reached its \nclimax in Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty when the two belligerent parties, \nbelievers and disbelievers, entered into a truce agreement that pointed \nmarkedly to the ever-growing power of Islam, and recorded \nunequivocally the perpetuity of this heavenly religion in pan-Arabia. \n\n\nti]ZfidAl-Ma\u2018ad, 2/122. \n\n\n\nAl-Hudaibiyah Treaty \n(Dhul Qa\u2018dah 6 A.H.) \n\nWhen Arabia began to witness the large impressive sweep in favour of \nthe Muslims, the forerunners of the great conquest and success of the \nIslamic Call started gradually to loom on the demographic horizon, and the \ntrue believers restored their undisputed right to observe worship in the \nsacred sanctuary. \n\nIt was about the sixth year Hijri when the Prophet ^ saw in a \n\ndream, while he was still in Madinah, that he had entered the sacred \nsanctuary in Makkah in security with his followers, and was performing the \nceremonies of \u2018Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). Their heads were being shaved \nand hair cut off. As soon as he informed some of his Companions the \ncontents of his dream, their hearts leapt up with joy since they found in it \nthe actualization of their deep longing to take part in pilgrimage and its \nhallowed rites after an exile of six years. \n\nThe Prophet had his clothes washed, mounted his camel and \n\nmarched out towards Makkah at the head of fifteen hundred Muslims \nincluding his wife Umm Salamah. Some desert bedouins whose Faith was \nlukewarm hung back and made excuses. They carried no weapons with \nthem except sheathed swords because they had no intention of fighting. Ibn \nUmm Maktum was mandated to dispose the affairs of Madinah during the \nProphet\u2019s absence. As they approached Makkah, and in a place called Dhi \nHulaifa, he ordered that the sacrificial animals be garlanded, and all \nbelievers donned Al-Ihram, the pilgrim\u2019s garb. He despatched a \nreconnoiterer to hunt around for news of the enemy. The man came back to \ntell the Prophet ^ <ui that a large number of slaves, as well as a huge \narmy, were gathered to oppose him, and that the road to Makkah was \ncompletely blocked. The Prophet consulted his Companions, \n\nwho were of the opinion that they would fight none unless they were \ndebarred from performing their pilgrimage. \n\nThe Quraishites, on their part, held a meeting during which they \nconsidered the whole situation and decided to resist the Prophet\u2019s mission at \nall costs. Two hundred horsemen led by Khalid bin Al-Waleed were \ndespatched to take the Muslims by surprise during Zuhr (the afternoon) \nprayer.

The Muslims avoided marching \non that way and decided to follow a rugged rocky one. Here, Khalid ran \nback to Quraish to brief them on the latest situation. \n\nWhen the Muslims reached a spot called Thaniyat Al-Marar, the \nProphet\u2019s camel stumbled and knelt down and was too stubborn to move. \nMuhammad fu, uii ^ swore he would willingly accede to any plan they \nput forward that would glorify Allah\u2019s sanctities. He then reprovingly \nspurred his camel and it leapt up. They resumed their march and came to \npitch their tents at the furthest part of Al-Hudaibiyah beside a well of scanty \nwater. The Muslims reported thirst to the Prophet ^ jL, who took an \narrow out of his quiver, and placed it in the ditch. Water immediately gushed \nforth, and his followers drank to their fill. When the Prophet had \n\nrested, Budail bin Warqa\u2019 Al-Khuza\u2018i with some celebrities of Khuza\u2019ah \ntribe, the Prophet\u2019s confidants, came and asked him what he had come for. \nThe Prophet ^ un ^ replied that it was not for war that he had come \nforth: \u201cI have no other design,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to perform \u2018Umrah (the lesser \npilgrimage) in the Holy Sanctuary. Should Quraish embrace the new \nreligion, as some people have done, they are most welcome, but if they \nstand in my way or debar the Muslims from pilgrimage, I will surely fight \nthem to the last man, and Allah\u2019s Order must be fulfilled.\u201d The envoy \ncarried the message back to Quraish, who sent another one called Mikraz \nbin Hafs. On seeing him, the Prophet ^ un ^ said that that was a \ntreacherous man. He was given the same message to communicate to his \npeople. He was followed by another ambassador known as Al-Hulais bin \n\u2018Alqamah. He was very much impressed by the spirit of devotion that the \nMuslims had for the Sacred Ka\u2019bah. He went back to his men and warned \nthem against debarring M uham mad ^ <ui and his Companions from \ndoing honour to Allah\u2019s house on the peril of breaking his alliance with \nthem. Hulais was succeeded by \u2018Urwa bin Mas'ud Ath-Thaqafi to negotiate \nwith Muhammad (j-, uii ^ In the course of discussion he said to the \nProphet ^ oji \u201cMuhammad! Have you gathered around yourself \nmixed people and then brought them against your kith and kin in order to \ndestroy them. By Allah I think I see you deserted by these people \ntomorrow.\u201d At this point Abu Bakr stood up and expressed his resentment at \nthis imputation. Al-Mugheerah bin Shu\u2019bah expressed the same attitude and \nreprovingly forbade him from touching the Prophet\u2019s beard. Here, Quraish\u2019s \n\n\n- 340 - \n\n\n\nenvoy remarked indignantly and alluded to the latter\u2019s treacherous act of \nkilling his companions and looting them before he embraced Islam. \nMeanwhile, \u2018Urwah, during his stay in the Muslim camp, had been closely \nwatching the unfathomable love and profound respect that the followers of \nMuhammad ^ vj* \u00abjii showed him. He returned and conveyed to Quraish \nhis impression that those people could not forsake the Prophet ^ ^ \u00abjji ^ \nunder any circumstances. He expressed his feelings in the following words: \n\u201cI have been to Chosroes, Caesar and Negus in their kingdoms, but never \nhave I seen a king among a people like Muhammad ^ among his \n\nCompanions. If he performs his ablution, they would not let the water \nthereof fall on the ground; if he expectorates, they would have the mucus to \nrub their faces with; if he speaks, they would lower their voices. They will \nnot abandon him for anything in any case. He, now, offers you a reasonable \nplan, so do what you please.\u201d \n\nSeeing an overwhelming tendency towards reconciliation among their \nchiefs, some reckless, fight-prone youngsters of Quraish devised a wicked \nplan that could hinder the peace treaty. They decided to infiltrate into the \ncamp of the Muslims and produce intentional skirmishes that might trigger \nthe fuse of war. Muhammad bin Maslamah, chief of the Muslim guards, \ntook them captives, but in view of the far-reaching imminent results about to \nbe achieved, the Prophet ^ 4*i* ^ set them free.

He was also asked to call them to Islam, \nand give glad tidings to the believers in Makkah, women and men, that the \n\n\n- 341 - \n\n\n\nconquest was approaching and Islam was surely to prevail because AllSh \nwould verily establish His religion in Makkah. \u2018Uthman also assured them \nthat after the performance of ceremonies they would soon depart peacefully, \nbut the Quraishites were adamant and not prepared to grant them the \npermission to visit Al-Ka\u2018bah. They, however, offered \u2018Uthman the \npermission to perform the pilgrimage, if he so desired in his individual \ncapacity, but \u2018Uthman declined the offer saying: \u201cHow is it possible that I \navail myself of this opportunity, when the Prophet ^ v\u00bb an ^ is denied of \nit?\u201d The Muslims anxiously waited for the arrival of \u2018Uthman with mingled \nfeelings of fear and anxiety. But his arrival was considerably delayed and a \nfoul play was suspected on the part of Quraish. The Muslims were greatly \nworried and took a solemn pledge at the hand of the Prophet ^ v\u00bb that \n\nthey would sacrifice their lives to avenge the death of their Companion and \nstand firmly by their master, Muhammad under all conditions. \n\nThis pledge goes by the name of Bay \u2018at Ar-Ridwart (a covenant of fealty). \nThe first men to take a pledge were Abu Sinan Al-Asadi and Salamah bin \nAl-Akwa\u2018, who gave a solemn promise to die in the cause of Truth three \ntimes, at the front of the army, in the middle and in the rear. The Prophet \njJl-j v* jii caught his left hand on behalf of \u2018Uthman. This fealty was sworn \nunder a tree, with \u2018Umar holding the Prophet\u2019s hand and Ma\u2018qil bin Yasar \nholding a branch of the tree up. The Noble Qur\u2019an has referred to this \npledge in die following words: \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeed, Allih was pleased with the believers when they gave \ntheir Bai'a (pledge) to you (O Muhammad^y.<m) under \nthe tree.\u201d [48:18] \n\n\nWhen Quraish saw the firm determination of the Muslims to shed the last \ndrop of blood for the defence of their Faith, they came to their senses and \nrealized that Muhammad\u2019s followers could not be cowed down by these \ntactics. After some further interchange of messages they agreed to conclude \na treaty of reconciliation and peace with the Muslims. The clauses of the \nsaid treaty go as follows: \n\n1. The Muslims shall return this time and come back next year, but they \nshall not stay in Makkah for more than three days. \n\n\n- 342 -", "start_char_idx": 669309, "end_char_idx": 672482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20d91daa-b3e4-4507-8d60-42550ce6fd49": {"__data__": {"id_": "20d91daa-b3e4-4507-8d60-42550ce6fd49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "504b4e50-ef22-4d1d-9064-bad7ed14006f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "2521bec18d5adfaea3088d2fb1d136d97b6bc8adad9bb390d5731420f121c9ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "823573e9-2ca4-472a-835c-06f69a3f1956", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "992198699882cf1e68c0f253c80e9fe6c8da332b7176ffecd552146233973b57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "296d9750894815edf1432737144a26d740ab96523c1eb692c175b34e882db790", "text": "\u201cIndeed, Allih was pleased with the believers when they gave \ntheir Bai'a (pledge) to you (O Muhammad^y.<m) under \nthe tree.\u201d [48:18] \n\n\nWhen Quraish saw the firm determination of the Muslims to shed the last \ndrop of blood for the defence of their Faith, they came to their senses and \nrealized that Muhammad\u2019s followers could not be cowed down by these \ntactics.

He then went on to dictate, \u201cThis is what \nMuh ammad , the Messenger of Allah has agreed to with Suhail bin \u2018Amr.\u201d \nUpon this Suhail again protested: \u201cHad we acknowledged you as Prophet, \nwe would not have debarred you from the Sacred House, nor fought against \nyou.

The Prophet \njjL-j 4 _ui however, in the larger interest of Islam, attached no importance \nto such an insignificant detail, erased the words himself, and dictated \ninstead: \u201cM uhammad , the son of 4 Abdullah.\u201d Soon after this treaty, Khuza\u2018a \nc l an, a former ally of Banu Hashim, joined the ranks of Muhammad ^ ^ aui \nand Banu Bakr sided with Quraish. \n\nIt was during this time while the treaty was being written that Abu \nJandal, Suhail\u2019s son, appeared on the scene. He was brutally chained and \nwas staggering with privation and fatigue. The Prophet ^ <in ^ and his \nCompanions were moved to pity and tried to secure his release but Suhail \nwas adamant and said: \u201cTo signify that you are faithful to your contract, an \nopportunity has just arrived.\u201d The Prophet <ui said: \u201cBut the treaty \n\n\n- 343 -", "start_char_idx": 671811, "end_char_idx": 674927, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "823573e9-2ca4-472a-835c-06f69a3f1956": {"__data__": {"id_": "823573e9-2ca4-472a-835c-06f69a3f1956", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20d91daa-b3e4-4507-8d60-42550ce6fd49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "296d9750894815edf1432737144a26d740ab96523c1eb692c175b34e882db790", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed92314c-1e87-4064-a792-dad921eb9673", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0824b7d4edf7675befa67e4b28b1fb9dc8c0c5e00a6cd154004f70ab17a3982a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "992198699882cf1e68c0f253c80e9fe6c8da332b7176ffecd552146233973b57", "text": "- 343 - \n\n\n\nwas not signed when your son entered the camp\u201d Upon this, he burst forth \nand said, \u201cbut the terms of the treaty were agreed upon.\u201d It was indeed an \nanxious moment.

The Prophet\u2019s heart welled up with sympathy, but he wanted \nto honour his word at all costs. He consoled Abu Jandal and said, \u201cBe \npatient, resign yourself to the Will of Allah.

However, in silent resignation was \ntherefore, Abu Jandal borne away with his chains. \n\nWhen the peace treaty had been concluded, the Prophet ,jl., \u00abjji ^ \nordered his Companions to slaughter their sacrificial animal s, but they were \ntoo depressed to do that The Prophet ^ \u00abw gave instructions in thi s \nregard three times but with negative response. He told his wife Umm \nSalamah about this attitude of his Companions. She advised that he hims elf \ntake the initiative, slaughter his animal and have his head shaved. Seeing \nthat, the Muslims, with rended hearts, started to slaughter their animals and \nshave their heads. They even almost killed one another because of their \ndistress. The Prophet ^ ^ prayed three times for those who shaved \n\ntheir heads and once for those who cut their hair. A camel was sacrificed on \nbehalf of seven men and a cow on behalf of the same number of people.

How could it be \notherwise when Quraish had recognized the legitimate Muslims\u2019 existence \non the scene of political life in Arabia, and began to deal with the believers \non equal terms. Quraish in the light of the articles of the treaty, had \nindirectly relinquished its claim to religious leadership, and admitted that \nthey were no longer interested in people other than Quraish, and washed \ntheir hands of any sort of intervention in the religious future of the Arabian \nPeninsula. The Muslims did not have in mind to seize people\u2019s property or \nkill them through bloody wars, nor did they ever think of pursuing any \ncoercive approaches in their endeavours to propagate Islam, on the contrary, \ntheir sole target was to provide an atmosphere of freedom as regards \nideology or religion: \n\n\u201cThen whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let \nhim disbelieve.\u201d [18:29] \n\nThe Muslims, on the other hand, had the opportunity to spread Islam over \nareas not then explored.

However, in the course of events, it \nproved to be a great blessing. The Muslims sent back to Makkah were not \nlikely to renounce the blessings of Islam; contrariwise, those very Muslims \nturned out to be centres of influence for Islam. It was impossible to think \nthat they would become apostates or renegades. The wisdom behind this \ntruce assumed its full dimensions in some subsequent events. After the \nProphet fj-j <-> \u00ab-ut had reached Madinah, Abu Baseer, who had escaped \nfrom Quraish, came to him as a Muslim; Quraish sent two men demanding \nhis return, so die Prophet ^ m handed him over to them. On the way \nto Makkah, Abu Baseer managed to kill one of them, and the other one fled \nto Madinah with Abu Baseer in pursuit. When he reached the Prophet \non jX., he said, \u201cYour obligation is over and Allah has freed you from \nit. You duly handed me over to the men, and AMh has rescued me from \nthem.\u201d The Prophet ^ un said, \u201cWoe is his mother, he would have \nkindled a war if there had been others with him.\u201d When he heard that, he \nknew tha t he would be handed back to them, so he fled from Madinah and \nwent as far as Saif Al-Bahr. The other Muslims who were oppressed in \nMakkah began to escape to Abu Baseer. He was joined by Abu Jandal and \nothers until a fair-sized colony was formed and soon sought revenge on \nQuraish and started to intercept their caravans. The pagans of Makkah \nfinding themselves unable to control those exiled colonists, begged the \nProphet fi\u2014^ \u00ab_ui jX to do away with the clause which governed the \nextradition. They implored him by Allah and by their ties of kinship to send \nfor the group, saying that whoever joined the Muslims in Madinah would be \nsafe from them. So the Prophet ^ on sent for the group and they \nresponded, as expected, positively. \n\nThese are the realities of the clauses of the truce treaty and as it seems \nthey all function in favour of the nascent Islamic state. However, two points \nin the treaty made it distasteful to some Muslims, namely they were not \n\n\n- 347 - \n\n\n\ngiven access to the Holy Sanctuary that year, and the seemingly humiliating \nattitude as regards reconciliation with the pagans of Quraish. \u2018Umar, unable \nto contain himself for the distress taking full grasp of his heart, went to the \nProphet {L., <w and said: \u201cAren\u2019t you the true Messenger of Allah?\u201d The \nProphet fi-j 4jii ^ replied calmly, \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u2018Umar again spoke and \nasked: \u201cAren\u2019t we on the path of righteousness and our enemies in the \nwrong?\u201d Without showing any resentment, the Prophet fU 3 \u00abw replied \nthat it was so. On getting this reply he further urged: \u201cThen we should not \nsuffer any humiliation in the matter of Faith.\u201d The Prophet ^ un was \nunruffled and with perfect confidence said: \u201cI am the true Messenger of \nAllah, I never disobey Him, He shall help me.\u201d \u201cDid you not tell us,\u201d \nrejoined \u2018Umar, \u201cthat we shall perform pilgrimage?\u201d \u201cBut I have never told \nyou,\u201d replied the Prophet (L., <> <m ^u, \u201cthat we shall do so this very year.\u201d \n\u2018Umar was silenced. But his mind was disturbed. He went to Abu Bakr and \nexpressed his feelings before him.

Ghatfan Tribe no longer constituted any remarkable threat, and \ntheir provocative deeds were mainly Jewish-instigated actions. The Jews, \nafter being banished from Madinah, resorted to Khaibar to change it into a \nhot bed of intrigues against the Prophet ^ There, they used to \n\nhatch their plots, ignite the fire of dissension and allure the Arabs living in \nthe vicinity of Madinah to join them with the aim of exterminating the new \nIslamic state, or at least inflict heavy losses on the Muslims. The Prophet \n(L. } u\u00ab jj-, not heedless of their devilish schemes, placed a decisive war \nwith them as a first priority on his agenda shortly after the endorsement of \nthe above-mentioned treaty. The treaty of Hudaibiyah allowed the Muslims \nto intensify their Islamic career and double up their ceaseless efforts in \npropagating their Da'wah, and consequently give this sort of action \npreponderance over the military activities. Hence, we deem it imperative to \ndivide this post-treaty stage into two sections: \n\n1. Ceaseless peaceful efforts in propagating the Islamic Da'wah \n(Call) and initiating a sort of correspondence with kings and \nprinces of the neighbouring political entities. \n\n2.

Then he called \nupon his translator and said (to him). \u2018Tell them (i.e. Abu Sufyan\u2019s \ncompanions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that \n\n\nPI Sahih Al-Bukhari, 1/4,5. \n\n\n- 356 - \n\n\n\nmen who claims to be a Prophet. So if he tells a lie, they should contradict \nhim (instantly)\u2019. \"By Allah had I not been afraid that my companions would \nconsider me a liar, I would have told lies\u201d, Abu Sufyan later said. \n\nAbu Sufyan\u2019s testimony went as follows: \u201cMuhammad descends from a \nnoble family. No one of his family happened to assume kingship. His \nfollowers are those deemed weak with numbers ever growing. He neither \ntells lies nor betrays others, we fight him and he fights us but with alternate \nvictory. He bids people to worship Allah Alone with no associate, and \nabandon our fathers\u2019 beliefs. He orders us to observe prayer, honesty, \nabstinence and maintain strong family ties.\u201d \u201cHercules, on hearing this \ntestimony, turned to his translator bidding him to communicate to us his \nfollowing impression which reveals full conviction in the truthfulness of \nM uhammad \u2019s Prophethood: \u2018I fully realize that Prophets come from noble \nfamilies; he does not affect any previous example of Prophethood. Since \nnone of his ancestors was a monarch, we cannot then allege that he is a man \ntrying to reclaim his father\u2019s monarchy. So long as he does not tell lies to \npeople, he is for the more reason, immune to telling lies as regards Allah. \nConcerning his followers being those deemed weak with numbers ever \ngrowing, it is something that goes in agreement with questions of Faith until \nthis latter assumes its full dimensions geographically and demographically. I \nhave understood that no instance of apostasy has as yet appeared among his \nfollowers, and this points to the bliss of Faith that finds its abode in the \nhuman heart. Betrayal, as I see, is alien to him because real Prophets hold \nbetrayal in abhorrence. Bidding worship of Allah with no associates, \nobservance of prayer, honesty and abstinence and prohibition of paganism \nare traits bound to rubject to him all my possessions. I have already known \nthat a Prophet must arise but it has never occurred to me that he will be an \nArab from among you.

I did not move from my place until I saw \nthe horsemen of the Messenger of Allah ^ \u00ab*u un ^ju, who came riding \nthrough the trees. The foremost among them was Akhram, behind him was \nAbu Qatadah Al-Ansari followed by Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad. Akhram and \n\u2018Abdur Rahman Al-Fazari met in combat. Akhram hamstrung \u2018Abdur \nRahman\u2019s horse but the latter managed to strike him with his lance and kill \nhim. \u2018Abdur Rahman turned around riding Akhram\u2019s horse.

The polytheists consequently fled away and I \nwas in their pursuit until before sunset they reached a valley with a spring of \nwater called Dhu Qarad. They rested there to have a drink. I however, \nr unning in hot pursuit, turned them out of the valley before they could drink \na drop of water. Later on, the Prophet ^ uii along with his \nCompanions, overtook me. I addressed him saying: Messenger of Allah, let \nme select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders \nand finish them. In reply, the Prophet said: \u201cIbn Al-Akwa\u2018, you \n\nhave taken enough and so now you have to show magnanimity; now they \nhave reached die habitation of Ghatfan where they are being feted.\u201d He \nadded saying: \u201cOur best horseman today is Abu Qatadah, and our best \nfootman today is Salamah.\u201d He allotted me two shares of the booty - the \nshare meant for the horseman and the other meant for the footman, and \ncombined both of them for me. Intending to return to Madinah, he made me \nmount behind him on his she-camel called Al-\u2018Adba\u2019. \n\n\n- 365 - \n\n\n\nThe Conquest of Khaibar \n(In Moharram, 7A.H.) \n\n\nKhaibar was a spacious strongly fortified territory, studded with castles \nand farms, lying at a distance of 60-80 miles north of Madinah, now a \nvillage known for its uncongenial climate. After Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty, the \nmajor party of the anti-Islam tripartite coalition \u2014Quraish, the bedouin \nhorde of Najd tribes and the Jews \u2014 was neutralized, therefore, the Prophet \nA\u2014i uji j-l. deemed it an appropriate time to settle his affairs with the other \ntwo wings \u2014 the Jews and the Najd tribes \u2014 in order that peace and \nsecurity could prevail and the Muslims may devote their time and effort in \npropagating the Message of Allah and calling people to embrace it. Khaibar \nitself had always remained a hotbed of intrigue and conspiracy, and the \nJews had always constituted it a source of military provocations and war \ninstigation centre, so it was given a top priority on the agenda of the \nProphet\u2019s compelling exigencies. The Jews of Khaibar had united by an \nancient alliance with the Confederates, triggered Bani Quraiza to practise \ntreachery, maintained contacts with Ghatfan and the Arabians and they even \ndevised an attempt at the Prophet\u2019s life. In fact, the continual afflictions that \nthe Muslims had sustained were primarily attributable to the Jews. Envoys \nwere repeatedly sent to them for peaceful settlement, but all in vain. \nConsequently the Prophet ^ *i* an ^ came to the conclusion that a military \ncampaign was a must in order to forestall their hostilities. \n\nInterpreters of the Noble Qur\u2019an suggest that capturing Khaibar had been \na Divine promise implied in Allah\u2019s Words: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAllah has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture, \nand He has hastened for you this.\u201d [48:20] \ni.e., Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty and the surrender of Khaibar. \n\n\nThe hypocrites and people weak of heart had hung back from jo ining the \ntrue Muslims in Al-Hudaibiyah campaigns, so now Allah, the All-Mighty \ninculcated the following words in His Prophet\u2019s ears: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n& 65 ^ jar d \n\n\n-y-'rVi \n\n\n- 366 -", "start_char_idx": 715869, "end_char_idx": 719607, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e248c8f-81ec-436d-961d-b24b101aadd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e248c8f-81ec-436d-961d-b24b101aadd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "060dfa25-f354-47ce-82a5-3fe883bd39f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "7860ae15ab53b5eb079f8a82053b02129f7074abb349723297a9719943e22406", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "700328af-9366-479f-8a88-e383b3db7b77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "881f1a6dfc3d2db52a3050a42e70034e982faec9779c165fe62503bc08961a6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fa5ab42a41ff88e092aa4366f7b4ea16ccc971985aad0793c5ce3d04fff3e772", "text": "\u201cAllah has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture, \nand He has hastened for you this.\u201d [48:20] \ni.e., Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty and the surrender of Khaibar. \n\n\nThe hypocrites and people weak of heart had hung back from jo ining the \ntrue Muslims in Al-Hudaibiyah campaigns, so now Allah, the All-Mighty \ninculcated the following words in His Prophet\u2019s ears: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n& 65 ^ jar d \n\n\n-y-'rVi \n\n\n- 366 - \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThose who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take \nthe spoils, \u2018Allow us to follow you.\u2019 They want to change \nAllah\u2019s Words.

Another incident of high significance is noteworthy, namely \nthe Islamization of Abu Huraira, a venerable Muslim scholar and an \nauthentic narrator of the Prophetic traditions. \n\n\nThe hypocrites of Arabia took notice of the fresh Islamic intentions so \nthey began to alert the Jews to the imminent military activities. Their chief, \n\u2018Abdullah bin Ubai delegated an envoy to the Jews of Khaibar warning \nthem against the dangers approaching, and nerving them to resist the \nMuslims as they outnumbered the latter and were better equipped. On \nhearing the news the Jews despatched Kinanah bin Abi Al-Huqaiq and \nHaudha bin Qais to their former allies, the tribe of Ghatfan requesting \nmilitary assistance, promising to grant them half the yield of the fiuit that \ntheir farms could yield if they managed to beat the Muslims. \n\nThe Prophet marched by way of Isra Mountain and then went forward \nwith the army till he halted in a valley called Ar-Raji\u2018, encamping between \nKhaibar and Ghatfan so as to prevent the latter from reinforcing the Jews. \nThe guides accompanying him led him to an intersection from which \nbranched out three roads with different designations; all leading to his \ndestination.

The first fort he was to attack was Na\u2018im, \nthe first defence line with a formidable strategic position. Marhab, the \nleader of the fort, invited \u2018 Amr bin Al-Akwa\u2018 to meet him in combat and the \nlatter responded; when \u2018Amr struck the Jew, his sword recoiled and \nwounded his knee, and he died of that wound. The Prophet ^ later \n\nsaid: \u201cFor him (\u2018Amir) there is a double reward in the Hereafter.\u201d He \nindicated this by putting two of his fingers together. \u2018Ali bin Abi Talib then \nundertook to meet Marhab in combat, and managed to kill him. Yasir, \nMarhab\u2019s brother, then turned up challenging the Muslims to a fight. Az- \nZubair was equal to it and killed him on the spot. Real fighting then broke \nout and lasted for a few days. The Jews showed courage and proved to be \ntoo formidable even to the repeated rushes of the veteran soldiers of Islam. \nHowever, they later realized the futility of resistance and began to abandon \ntheir positions in An-Na\u2018im and infiltrate into the fortress of As-Sa\u2018b. \n\nAl-Hubab bin Al-Mundhir Al-Ansari led the attack on As-Sa\u2018b fortress \nand laid siege to it for three days after which the Muslims stormed it with a \nlot of booty, provisions and food to fall to their lot therein. This victory \ncame in the wake of the Prophet\u2019s ^ \u00abdi ^ invocation to Allah to help \nBanu Aslam in their relentless and daring attempts to capture that fort. \n\nDuring the process of the war operations, extreme hunger struck the \nMuslims. They lit fires, slaughtered domestic asses and began to cook them. \nWhen the Prophet ^ \u00ab*u uji ^ inquired about the fires and cooking, he \nordered that they throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots, \nforbidding the practice of eating such meat. \n\nThe Jews, meanwhile, evacuated An-Natat and barricaded themselves in \nAz-Zubair fort, a formidable defensive position inaccessible to both cavalry \nand infantry. The Muslims besieged it for three days, but in vain.

The same events recurred; the Muslims besieged the new \nsite for three days and then the great Muslim hero Abu Dujanah Sammak \nbin Kharshah Al-Ansari \u2014 of the red ribbon \u2014 led the Muslim army and \nbroke into the castle, conducted fierce military operations within and forced \nthe re mainin g Jews to flee for their lives into another fort, An-Nizar. \n\nAn-Nizar was the most powerful fort, and the Jews came to the \nestablished conviction that it was too immune to be stormed, so they \ndeemed it a safe place for their children and women. The Muslims, \nhowever, were not dismayed but dragged on the siege, but because standing \nat a commanding top, the fort was impregnable. The Jews inside were too \ncowardly to meet the Muslims in open fight but rather hurled a shower of \narrows and stones on the attackers.

After \ninvestigation, the woman confessed that she had stuffed the food with \npoison alleging that if the eater were a king, she would then rid herself of \nhim, but should he be a Prophet, then he would be bound to learn about it. \nThe Prophet y\u2014, j-., however, connived at her treacherous attempt, but \n\nordered that she be killed when Bishr bin Al-Bara\u2019 died of that poison. \n\nThe number of Muslims who were martyred was controversial, but it \nranged between 16 and 18, while the number of Jews killed came to 93. \n\nThe rest of Khaibar also fell to the Muslims. Allah cast fear into the \nhearts of the people of Fadak, a village standing to the north of Khaibar, and \nthey hastened to ask for peace, and be allowed to leave in safety, and give \nup their wealth in return for that The Prophet y, y- entered into an \nagreement with them similar to the previous one with the people of Khaibar. \nFadak was exclusively the Prophet\u2019s because neither Muslim cavalry nor \ncamelry were involved in fight thereby. \n\nNo sooner had the Prophet y^ .any. discharged the affair of Khaibar \nthan he started a fresh move towards Wadi Al-Qura, another Jewish colony \nin Arabia.

Prior to fighting, he invited the Jews \nto embrace Islam but all his words and exhortations fell on deaf ears. Eleven \nof the Jews were killed one after another and with each one newly killed, a \nfresh call was extended inviting those people to profess the new faith. \nFighting went on ceaselessly for approximately two days and resulted in full \nsurrender of the Jews.

Unlike the Jews of Khaibar and people \nof Makkah, they had a liking for living in the wilderness dispersed in \nscattered spots, hence the difficulty of bringing them under control, and the \nfutility of carrying out deterrent campaigns against them. However, the \nProphet fL-j uji jX. was determined to put an end to this unacceptable \nsituation and called the Muslims around him to get ready to launch a \ndecisive campaign against those harassing rebels. Meanwhile it was \nreported to him that Bani Muharib and Banu ThaTbah of the Ghatfan tribe \nwere gathering army in order to encounter the Muslims.

We could in this context mention some of these \nincidental skirmishes which pointed markedly to the ever-growing power of \nthe Muslim society. \n\n1. A platoon headed by Ghalib bin \u2018Abdullah Al-Laithi in Safar or in Rabi\u2018 \nAl-Awwal 7 A.H. was despatched to muffle the provocative behaviour of \nBani Al-Muluh. The Muslims managed to kill a large number of the \nenemy soldiers and captured a great deal of booty. A large army of \npolytheists rushed in their heel but floods hindered the pursuit, and the \nMuslims managed to withdraw in safety. \n\n2. \u2018Umar bin Al-Khattab, at the head of a 30-soldier group, set out to a spot \ncalled Turbah in Sha\u2018ban 7 A.H. to discipline the people of Hawazin. He \nno longer arrived at their habitation that they fled for their lives. \n\n3. Thirty men with Basheer bin Sa\u2018d Al-Ansari headed for Bani Murrah in \nSha\u2018ban 7 A.H. in Fadak area. He killed a large number of the enemy and \nseized a lot of their camels and cattle. On his way back, the enemy \ngathered up forces and overtook the Muslims at night. They showered \nBasheer and his men with arrows, and killed all the Muslims except \nBasheer, who took refuge in Fadak and stayed with the Jews there until \nhis wounds healed. \n\n4. Ghalib bin \u2018Abdullah Al-Laithi at the head of a platoon of 130 men \n\nlaunched an attack against Bani \u2018Awal and Bani \u2018Abd bin Thaibah in \nRamadan 7 A.H. They killed some of die enemy\u2019s men and captured \ntheir cattle and camels. \u2018Usama bin Zaid killed Mardas bin Nahik, a \npolytheist, but after he had pronounced the testimony of Allah\u2019s Oneness \nto which incident the Prophet commented addressing his \n\nCompanions: \u201cWould you rip open his heart to discern whether he is \ntruthful or a liar?\u201d \n\n5. A thirty-horseman group headed by \u2018Abdullah bin Rawaha marched \ntowards Khaibar on reports that Aseer (or Basheer bin Razam) was \nrallying the ranks of Bani Ghatfan to attack the Muslims: They managed \nto persuade that Jew to follow them to Madinah encouraging him that the \nProphet pu-j uii ^ would institute him as a ruler of Khaibar. On their \nway back there occurred a sort of misunderstanding that gave rise to \n\n\n- 378 - \n\n\n\nfierce fighting between the two parties resulting in the death of Aseer and \nthe thirty men with him. \n\n6. In Shawwal 7 A.H., Basheer bin Sa\u2018d Al-Ansari marched towards Yemen \nand Jabar at the head of300 Muslim fighters to subdue a large mob of \npolytheists who gathered to raid the outskirts of Madinah. Basheer and \nhis men used to march at night and lurk during the day until they reached \ntheir destination.

He proceeded with 2000 men besides \nsome women and children!'1, and 60 camels for sacrifice, to visit the Holy \nSanctuary in Makkah. The Muslims took their weapons with them fearing \nthe treachery of the Quraishites, but left them with a party of two hundred \nmen at a place some eight miles from Makkah.

The Prophet had these relieved, and they went through the \nsame devotions as the others did. \n\nOn the morning of the fourth day of the pilgrimage, the notables of \nQuraish asked \u2018Ali bin Abi Talib to tell the Prophet (i~, \u00abm to leave \nMakkah along with his Companions. He, of course, could not conceive of \nviolating the terms of Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty, therefore he ordered his men \nto depart for a village called Sarif where he stayed for some time. \n\nIt was during this visit of the Prophet uii ^ to Makkah for \npilgrimage that his uncle \u2018Abbas offered the hand of his sister-in-law, \nMaimuna \u2014 the daughter of Harith, to him. The Prophet was \n\nkind enough to accept this offer since it was an effective step towards \ncementing the ties of relationship between the Prophet and the \n\ninfluential men of Makkah. The wedding took place in Sarif. HI \n\nNarrators attached different designations to this lesser pilgrimage. Some \ncalled it the compensatory lesser pilgrimage, performed instead of that \nuncompleted of Hudaibiyah; and the other one, given preponderance by \njurists, is the lesser pilgrimage consequent on certain terms of a treaty \nalready agreed upon. \n\nOn the whole, compensatory, judicial consent, retribution and \nreconciliation are all terms applicable to that visit. \n\nSome military operations, directed against some still obdurate desert \nArabians, took place at the conclusion of the lesser pilgrimage, of which we \ncould mention: \n\n1. A platoon of 50 men led by Ibn Abi Al-\u2018Awja\u2019was despatched by the \n\nProphet to the habitations of Bani Saleem inviting them to \n\nembrace Islam, but all the words fell on deaf ears. Fierce fighting erupted \nbetween both parties during which the Muslim leader was wounded, and \ntwo of the enemy were captured. \n\n2.

The Byzantine Empire, at that time, was a power to be reckoned \nwith, and mere thinking of antagonizing it used to mean self-annihilation, \nlet alone a three-thousand-soldier army going into fight against 200,000 \nsoldiers far better equipped and lavishly furnished with all luxurious \nconveniences. The battle was a real miracle proving that the Muslims were \nsomething exceptional not then familiar. Moreover, it gave evidence that \nAllah backed them and their Prophet, Muhammad, was really Allah\u2019s \nMessenger. In the light of these new strategic changes, the archenemies \namong the desert bedouins began to reconcile themselves with the new \nuprising faith and several recalcitrant tribes like Banu Saleem, Ashja 1 , \nGhatfan, Dhubyan, Fazarah and others came to profess Islam out of their \nown sweet free will. \n\nMu\u2019tah Battle, after all, constituted the forerunner of the blood encounter \nto take place with the Byzantines subsequently. It pointed markedly to a \nnew epoch of the Islamic conquest of the Byzantine empire and other \nremote countries, to follow at a later stage. \n\nDhat As-Salasil Campaign: \n\nDhat As-Salasil is a spot situated ten days\u2019 walk north of Madinah. The \nMuslims are said to have encamped in a place with a well of water called \nSalsal, hence the terminology Dhat As-Salasil. In view of the alliance \nbetween the Arabian tribes on the borders of Syria and the Byzantines, the \nProphet fL-j <_iii deemed it of top urgency to carry out a wisely-planned \nmanoeuvre that might bring about a state of rapport with those bedouins, \nand would at the same time detach them from the Byzantines. For the \nimplementation of this plan, he chose \u2018Amr bin Al-\u2018As, whose paternal \ngrandmother came from Bali, a tribe dwelling in that area. This motive in \nmind, combined with provocative military movements, by Bani Quda\u2018a, \nprecipitated this preemptive strike which started in Jumada Ath-Thaniya, 8 \nA.H. \n\n\u2018Amr bin Al-\u2018As was awarded a white flag with a black banner to go \nwith it. He set out at the head of300 Emigrants and Helpers assisted by a \ncavalry of 30 men, and was recommended to seek help from Bali, \u2018Udhra \nand Balqain tribes. He used to march at night and lurk during the day. On \n\n\n- 386 - \n\n\n\napproaching the enemy lines and realizing the large build up of men, he sent \nfor reinforcements from Madinah, and these arrived on the spot headed by \nAbu \u2018Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah leading further 200 men as well as other \nplatoons including Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar bin Al-Khattab. All of them were \ngiven strict orders to cooperate, work in harmony and never leave any area \nfor disagreement. \n\nAt noon, Abu \u2018Ubaidah wanted to lead the Muslims in prayer, but \u2018 Amr \nobjected on grounds that the former came only to assist, and leadership in \nprayer was given to \u2018Amr. \n\nThe Muslim army reached the habitations of Quda\u2018a and penetrated deep \nin their land, destroyed the enemies and obliged the others to flee for their \nlives in different directions. \n\nAt the conclusion of the military operations, a courier was despatched to \nthe Messenger of Allah ^ un ^ to brief him on the developments of \nevents and the ultimate victory achieved. \n\nKhadrah Campaign: \n\nIn Sha\u2018ban month 8 A.H., news reached the Prophet ^ ^ uii of \namassing troops by Bani Ghatfan, still outside the domain of Islam. He \nurgently summoned Abu Qatadah and sent him at the head of fifteen men to \ndiscipline those outlaws. \n\nIt took fifteen days to teach them an unforgettable lesson.

Abu Bakr, meanwhile, came in and asked \u2018 Aishah \u00abui ^ what the \nmatter was, showing surprise at the preparations being made as it was not, \nas he said, the usual time for war. She replied that she had no idea. On the \nmorning of the third day \u2018Amr bin Sdlim Al-Khuza\u2018i arrived in the company \nof forty horsemen to brief die Prophet ^ \u00abn on the plight of his people \nand seeking the Muslims' help for retaliation. People of Madinah then got to \nknow that Quraish had breached die covenant Budail followed \u2018Amr, and \nthen Abu Sufyan and the news was unequivocally confirmed. \n\nWith view of securing a complete news black-out concerning his military \nintentions, the Prophet ^ *bi despatched an eight-men platoon under \nthe leadership of Qatadah bin Rab\u2018i in the direction of Edam, a short \ndistance from Madinah, in Ramadan 8 A.H., in order to divert the attention \nof people and screen off the main target with which he was preoccupied. \n\nThere was so much dread and fear everywhere that Hatib, one of the \nmost trusted followers of the Prophet secretly despatched a \n\nfemale messenger with a letter to Makkah containing intimation of the \nintended attack. The Prophet ^received news from die heaven of \n\nHatib\u2019s action and sent \u2018Ali and Al-Miqdad with instructions to go after her. \nThey overtook the messenger, and after a long search discovered the letter \ncarefully hidden in her locks. The Prophet , 0 -, *ui summoned Hatib and \nasked him what had induced him to this act. He replied, \u201cO Messenger of \nAllih ft-j *> <jm yJ-1 I have no affinity of blood with Quraish; there is only a \nkind of friendly relationship between them and myself. My family is at \nMakkah and there is no one to look after it or to offer protection to it. My \nposition stands in striking contrast to that of the refugees whose families are \nsecure due to their blood ties with Quraish. I felt that since I am not related \nto them, I should, for the safety of my children, earn their gratitude by doing \ngood to them. I swear by Allah that I have not done this act as an apostate, \nforsaking Islam. I was prompted only by the considerations I have just \nexplained.\u201d \n\n\u2018Umar wanted to cut his head offas a hypocrite, but the Prophet \naccepted his excuse and granted him pardon, then addressed \u2018Umar saying: \nM Hatib is one of those who fought in the battle of Badr. How do you know \nthat he is a hypocrite? Allah is likely to look favourably on those who \n\n\n- 390 - \n\n\n\n\nparticipated in that battle. Turning then, to Hatib, he said: \u201cDo as you \nplease, for I have forgiven you.\u201d \n\nAfter making full preparation, the Prophet fi_y <jji ^ proceeded to \nMakkah at the head of ten thousand soldiers on the 10th of Ramadan, 8 A.H. \nHe mandated Abu Ruhm Al-Ghifari to dispose the affairs of Madinah \nduring his absence.

The Quraishites were \nquite unaware of the development of affairs, but the Prophet ^ ^ <ui did \nnot like to take them by surprise.

For it affected the course of \nevents and consequently altered the Arabs\u2019 whole life. It was a decisive \ndistinction between preconquest and post-conquest periods. For Quraish, \nat that time, was in the eyes of Arabs the defenders and helpers of Arabs. \nOther Arabs are only their ancillaries. The submission of Quraish is, \ntherefore, estimated to be a final elimination of paganism in the Arabian \nPeninsula. \n\nThis stage can be divided into two main phases: \n\nThe phase of: (1) holy wars and fighting. \n\n(2) the tribes and people\u2019s race to embrace Islam. \n\nBeing so close and rather inseparable, the two phases of this stage \nintervene in such a way that a happening of one phase occurs during the \nprogress of the other. However, we have preferred \u2014 for expository \npurposes \u2014 to deal with these two phases distinctively.

They \nthought that they were too mighty to admit or surrender to such a victory. \nSo they met Malik bin \u2018Awf An-Nasri and made up their mind to proceed \nfighting against the Muslims. \n\nThe Enemy\u2019s March and their Encampment at Awtas: \n\nWhen Malik bin \u2018Awf \u2014 the general leader \u2014 decided to march and \nfight the Muslims, he made his countrypeople take their wealth, women and \nchildren with them to Awtas \u2014 which is a valley in Hawazin land and is \nquite near Hunain. It differs from Hunain in its being adjacent to Dhi- \nAl-Majaz which is around ten miles from Makkah in \u2018Arafat\u2019s direction.1'1 \n\nThe War-experienced Man wrongs the Leader\u2019s Judgement: \n\nAs soon as they had camped in Awtas, people crowded round Malik. The \nold sane Duraid bin As-Simmah, who was well-known as a war-experienced \nman, and who was among those who gathered round Malik, asked: \u201cWhat \nvalley are we in?\u201d \u201cIn Awtas,\u201d they said. \u201cWhat a good course it is for \nhorses!

So at the moment they were cam p ing, arrows began showering \nintensively at them, whereas the enemy\u2019s battalions started a fierce attack \nagainst the Muslims, who had to retreat in disorder and utter confusion. It \nwas such a shatteringly defeat that Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who had recently \nembraced Islam, said that their retreat would not stop till they got to the Red \nSea. Jablah or Kildah bin Al-Junaid commented on that by saying: \u201cSurely \nmagic has grown inactive today.\u201d \n\nThe Messenger of Allah \u00abui turned to the right and said: \u201cCome \non, people! I am the Messenger of AUSh. I am M uhamma d, the son of \nAbdullah.\u201d Those who stoodfast by him were only few Emigrants and some \nof his kinsmen. The matchless bravery of the Prophet fi- y was then \n\nbrought to light.

The Prophet fU, mu \u00abw ju gave Al-Harith bin \nHarith bin Kilda a hundred camels. He also gave some chiefs of Quraish and \nother clans a hundred camels; he gave others fifty and some others had \nforty. \n\nEventually it was spread among people that \u201cMuhammad grants \ngenerously and fears not to grow poor.\u201d This made bedouins gather around \nhim expecting to be given some wealth.

Then the Messenger \nof Allah 'JL, \u00abu .tin said: \u201cThese people have come to you as Muslims. For \nthis I have already tarried the distribution of the booty. Besides, I have \ngranted them a fair option but they refused to have anything other than their \nwomen and children. Therefore he who has some of theirs and will prefer \nwillingly to give them back, let them do. But those who favours to keep \nwhat he owns to himself, let them grant them back too, and he will be given \nas a recompense six times as much from the first booty that Allah may \nprovide us.\u201d People then said, \u201cWe will willingly offer them all for the sake \nof the Messenger of Allah.\u201d The Messenger of Allah ^ \u00abu <jii said: \u201cBut \nin this way we are not able to find out who is content and who is not.

The only one who refused \nto comply with the Messenger\u2019s desire was \u2018Uyaina bin Hisn. He refused to \nlet an old woman of theirs go back at first. Later on he let her go back.

It consisted of fifty horsemen, none of them \nwas an Emigrant or a Helper. \n\nThis expedition was dispatched due to the fact that Bani Tamim had \nalready urged other tribes not to pay tribute (Al-Jizya) and eventually \nstopped them from paying it \n\nTherefore, \u2018Uyaina bin Hisn set out to fight them. All the way long he \nmarched by night and lurked by day. He went on that way till he \novertook them and attacked them in die desert. They fled back for their \nlives. Eleven men, twenty-one women and thirty boys were captured \nthen. He drove them back to Madinah and were housed in Ramlah bint \nAl-Harith\u2019s residence. Ten of their leaders, who came to the Prophet\u2019s \ndoor, called out unto him saying: \u201cO Muhammad come out and face us.\u201d \nWhen he went out they held him and started talking. \n\nHe exchanged talk with them for a while then left them and went to \nperform the noon-prayer. After prayer he sat in the mosque-patio. They \nproclaimed a desire to show boasting and self-pride. For this purpose \nthey introduced their orator \u2018Utarid bin Hajib who delivered his speech. \nThe Messenger of Allah ,jl, \u00abw asked Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas \n\u2014 the Muslim orator \u2014 to respond. He did that. In return, they brought \nforth their poet Az-Zabraqan bin Badr who recited some boastful poetry. \nHassan bin Thabit, the poet of Islam, promptly replied back. When talks \nand poetry came to an end, Al-Aqra\u2018 bin Habis said: \u201cTheir orator is \nmore eloquent than ours, and their poet is more poetically learned than \nours. Their voices and sayings excel ours, as well.\u201d Eventually they \nannounced their embracing Islam.

As a result of which, the Arabs had no more \ndoubt in Muhammad\u2019s mission. Thus we see that things went contrary to the \npagans\u2019 expectations. People started to embrace Islam, the religion of Allah, \nin great numbers. This is manifested clearly in the chapter \u2014 The \ndelegations, of this book. It can also be deduced out of the enormous \nnumber of people who shared in the Hajjatul- Wadd \u2018(Farewell Pilgrimage). \nAll domestic troubles came to an end. Muslims, eventually felt at ease and \nstarted setting up the teachings of Allah\u2019s Laws and intensifying the Call to \nIslam. \n\nThe underlying Reasons: \n\nThe Byzantine power, which was considered the greatest military force \non earth at that time, showed an unjustifiable opposition towards Muslims. \nAs we have already mentioned, their opposition started at killing the \nambassador of the Messenger of Allah fi\u2014 3 <jji Al-Harith bin \u2018Umair \nAl-Azdi, by Sharhabeel bin \u2018Amr Al-Ghassani. The ambassador was then \ncarrying a message from the Prophet ^ * 1 * <ui ju to the ruler of Busra. We \nhave also stated that the Prophet consequently dispatched a brigade under \nthe command of Zaid bin Haritha, who had a fierce fight against the \nByzantines at Mu\u2019tah. Although Muslim forces could not have revenge on \nthose haughty overproud tyrants, the confrontation itself had a great \nimpression on the Arabs, all over Arabia. \n\nCaesar \u2014 who could neither ignore the great benefit that Mu\u2019tah Battle \nhad brought to Muslims, nor could he disregard the Arab tribes\u2019 \nexpectations of independence, and their hopes of getting free from his \ninfluence and reign, nor he could ignore their alliance to the Muslims \u2014 \nrealizing all that, Caesar was aware of the progressive danger threatening \nhis borders, especially Ash-Sham-fronts which were neighbouring Arab \nlands. So he concluded that demolition of the Muslims power had grown an \nurgent necessity. This decision of his should, in his opinion, be achieved \nbefore the Muslims become too powerful to conquer, and raise troubles and \nunrest in the adjacent Arab territories. \n\n\n- 422 -", "start_char_idx": 832137, "end_char_idx": 834484, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac583d2b-ca26-4027-bd89-e8a7c0b1429b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac583d2b-ca26-4027-bd89-e8a7c0b1429b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e16138f1-3ce5-4ad2-a41b-ef2dd0e80131", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "bcba17866c2210c7536c9514b83f82b98ec3cb0f27044e2035c3f64b3f6a8d3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7993a49a-9c48-4f81-9be8-950cc181c54b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5205fbbf35ea35ec2f6790e328f4ef754430e71f5e76feda0d90602499f3634", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6449fc664114ce9ed55c929363b373ec145c95129cd0507d7f9c23b8e3058ca7", "text": "- 422 - \n\n\n\nTo meet these exigencies, Caesar mustered a huge army of the \nByzantines and pro-Roman Ghassanide tribes to launch a decisive bloody \nbattle against the Muslims. \n\nGeneral News about the Byzantines and Ghassanide Preparations for \nWar. \n\nNo sooner news about the Byzantine\u2019s preparations for a decisive \ninvasion against Muslims reached Madinah than fear spread among them. \nThey started to envisage the Byzantine invasion in the least sound they \ncould hear.

Therefore, he deserted them and kept \noff in a private place. At the beginning, the Companions of the Messenger \nof Allah were puzzled and could not work out the reason for such \nbehaviour. They thought the Prophet ^ \u00abui had divorced them and that \nwas why he was grieved, disturbed and upset.

The seriousness of the situation \nwas confirmed to a large degree by the hypocrites behaviour, when news \nabout the Byzantines\u2019 preparations reached Madinah. The fact that the \nMessenger of Allih ^ on ^ won all the battles he fought, and that no \npower on earth could make him terrified, and that he had always proved to \nbe able to overcome all the obstacles that stood in his way - did not prevent \nthe hypocrites, who concealed evil in their hearts, from expecting an \naffliction to fall upon the Muslims and Islam. \n\nThey used to harbour evil and ill-intentions against the whole process of \nIslam and the Muslims. On grounds of illusory hopes of destroying this \ngreat religious edifice, they erected a hotbed of conspiracy and intrigue in \nthe form of a mosque \u2014 Masjid-e-Darar (the mosque of harm). They \napproached the Prophet with the request that he should come and \n\nconsecrate the place by praying in it himself. As he was at the moment \nabout to start for Tabuk, he deferred compliance with their request till his \nreturn. Meanwhile he came to know through Divine Revelation that it was \nnot a Mosque for devotion and prayer but a meeting place for the anti- \nIslamic elements. On his return, therefore, the Prophet an sent a \nparty to demolish the new structure. \n\nParticular News about the Byzantine and \nGhassanide Preparations for War: \n\nA magnified image of the prominent danger threatening the Muslims life \nwas carried to them by the Nabateans who brought oil from Ash-Sham to \nMadinah. They carried news about Heraclius\u2019preparations and equipment \nof an enormous army counting over forty thousand fighters besides Lukham, \nJudham and other tribes allied to the Byzantines. They said that its vanguard \nhad already reached Al-Balqa\u2019. Thus was the grave situation standing in \nambush for the Muslims.

In that speech he urged the \nMuslims to seek the welfare of this world and the world to come. He warned \nand cherished them and gave them good tidings. By doing that he cherished \nthose who were broken in spirits, and blocked up the gap of shortage and \nmess they were suffering from due to lack of supplies, food and other \nsubstances. \n\nUpon learning of the Muslims\u2019 march, the Byzantines and their allies \nwere so terrified that none of them dared set out to fight. On the contrary \nthey scattered inside their territory. It brought, in itself, a good credit to the \nMuslim forces. That had gained military reputation in the mid and remote \nlands of Arabian Peninsula. The great and serious political profits that the \nMuslim forces had obtained, were far better than the ones they could have \nacquired if the two armies had been engaged in military confrontation. \n\nThe Head of Ailah, Yahna bin Rawbah came to the Messenger of Allah \nfi^ s \u00abjji ^ju, made peace with him and paid him the tribute (. Al-Jizya ). Both \nof Jarba\u2019 and Adhruh peoples paid him tribute, as well. So the Messenger of \nAllah ,JL\u2014 3 <^u \u00abjui j* gave each a guarantee letter, similar to Yahna\u2019s, in which \nhe says: \n\n\u201cIn the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. \n\nThis is a guarantee of protection from Allah and Muhammad the \nProphet, the Messenger of Allah, to Yahna bin Rawbah and the \npeople of Ailah; their ships, their caravans on land and sea shall \n\n\n111 ibid.Sahih Muslim, 2/246. \n\n\n- 429 -", "start_char_idx": 845495, "end_char_idx": 849288, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4de3598-b2b6-42bb-986a-e58ebc367f68": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4de3598-b2b6-42bb-986a-e58ebc367f68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9adf709a-ed8c-447f-8058-fb6e87aee755", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "5d125842460c41b77216c6028fb9cb19e48e9666c0dd1f91101c9e9c2d7018be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "27b8851f-1774-4d34-961c-ba7e93211f75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "317656a1282d416cfc5ae3903369bc6ea2af6d66b016ce6eb18f58dd93e71c02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b6a48e8f71a7966da4677b68f23f27d97b9aadf3cf84e57b32601b1e430f1c03", "text": "111 ibid.Sahih Muslim, 2/246. \n\n\n- 429 - \n\n\n\nhave the custody of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad, he and \nwhosoever are with him of Ash-Sham people and those of the sea. \nWhosoever contravenes this treaty, his wealth shall not save him; it \nshall be the fair prize of him that takes it. Now it should not be \nlawful to hinder the men from any springs which they have been in \nthe habit of frequenting, nor from any journeys they desire to make, \nwhether by sea or by land.\u201d \n\nThe Messenger of Allah pL., \u00ab\u00abu \u00abw dispatched Khalid bin Al-Waleed at \nthe head of four hundred and fifty horsemen to \u2018Ukaidir Dumat Al-Jandal \nand said to him: \u201cYou will see him hunting oryxes.\u201d So when Khalid drew \nnear his castle and was as far as an eye-sight range, he saw the oryxes \ncoming out rubbing their horns against the castle gate. As it was a moony \nnight Khalid could see Ukaidir come out to hunt them, so he captured him \n\u2014 though he was surrounded by his men \u2014 and brought him back to the \nMessenger of Allih (L., <*l. uh ir ju, who spared his life and made peace with \nhim for the payment of two thousand camels, eight hundred heads of cattle, \nfour hundred armours and four hundred lances. He obliged him to recognize \nthe duty of paying tribute and charged him with collecting it from Dumat, \nTabuk, Ailah and Taima\u2019. \n\nThe tribes, who used to ally the Byzantines, became quite certain that \ntheir dependence oinn their former masters came to an end. Therefore they \nturned into being pro-Muslims. The Islamic state had therefore enlarged its \nborders to an extent that it, touched the Byzantines\u2019 and their agents\u2019 \nborders. So we see that the Byzantine agents role was over. \n\nReturning to Madinah: \n\nThe Muslim army returned from Tabuk victoriously, undeceived or \nwronged. That was because AllSh had sufficed them the evils of fight. \n\nOn the way back and at a mountain road, twelve hypocrites sought the \nProphet\u2019s life and that was while he was passing along that mountain road \nwith only Ammar holding the rein of his she-camel and Hudhaifa bin \nAl-Yaman driving it, at the time that people had already gone down into the \nbottom of the valley. \n\nThe hypocrites seized that opportunity to seek the Prophet\u2019s life. As the \nMessenger of Allah ^ \u00abui ^ and his two companions were moving along. \n\n\n- 430 - \n\n\n\nthey heard thrusts of people coming towards him from behind with their \nfaces veiled. Hudhaifa, who was sent by the Prophet to see what was going \non, saw them and stroke their mounts\u2019 faces with a crook in his hand and \nAllah cast fear into their hearts. They fled away and overtook their people. \n\nHowever, Hudhaifa named them to the Messenger of Allah ^ <ui \n\nand informed him of their intentions. So that was why Hudhaifa was called \nthe \u201cconfidant\u201d of the Messenger of Allah ^ <ui About this event \nAllah, the Exalted says: \n\n\u201cAnd they resolved that (plot to murder Prophet Muhammad \n\n(L, } jj) which they were unable to carry out.\u201d [9:74] \n\nWhen his headquarters, Madinah, began to loom at the horizon, the \nProphet 4*u A-jui said: \u201cThis is a cheerful sight. This is Uhud, which is a \nmountain, we like it and it likes us.\u201d When the Madinese leamt of their \narrival they set out to meet the army.

So we see that this Ghazwah took fifty days, twenty \ndays of which were spent in Tabuk and the others on the way to and fro. \nTabuk Invasion was the last one made by the Prophet ^ j*.", "start_char_idx": 849248, "end_char_idx": 853031, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27b8851f-1774-4d34-961c-ba7e93211f75": {"__data__": {"id_": "27b8851f-1774-4d34-961c-ba7e93211f75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4de3598-b2b6-42bb-986a-e58ebc367f68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "b6a48e8f71a7966da4677b68f23f27d97b9aadf3cf84e57b32601b1e430f1c03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "11d6ce0c-66e9-4e17-93c0-ee8abb25b560", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc8d3d3d0aad1a4228da0a981ff55557d4ee39b367ffec6142e9be7fccf9cfe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "317656a1282d416cfc5ae3903369bc6ea2af6d66b016ce6eb18f58dd93e71c02", "text": "The People Who lagged Behind: \n\nDue to its particular circumstances, this invasion was a peculiar severe \ntrial provided by Allah only to try the believers\u2019Faith and sort them out of \nothers.

In this respect \n\nHe says: \u00bb \n\n\n- 431 - \n\n\n\n\u201cAllah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are \nnow, until He distinguish^the wicked from the good.\u201d [3:179] \n\nLagging and hanging back from full participation in that invasion \namounted to the degree of hypocrisy. Whenever the Messenger of Allah \nft-; uii yju was informed of a man\u2019s lingering, he would say: \u201cLeave him \nalone! If Allah knows him to be good He will enable him to follow you; but \nif he were not so, Allah would relieve us of him.\u201d \n\nNobody stayed behind except those who were either hindered by a \nserious excuse or the hypocrites who told lies to Allah and His Messenger. \n\nSome of those hypocrites\u2019 lingering was due to an excuse based on \nforgery and delusion. Some others tarried but didn\u2019t ask for an instant \npermission. But there were three believers who unjustifiably lingered. They \nwere the ones whom Allah tried their Faith, but later on He turned to them \nin mercy and accepted their repentance. \n\nAs soon as the Messenger of Allah ^ \u00abw had entered Madinah, he \nprayed two Rah'a then he sat to receive his people.

Everybody turned them their back. So they \nfelt as if the whole land had become constrained to them in spite of its \nspaciousness and they felt awkward and uneasy. The hard times they lived \nand which lasted for over forty days were towered by an order to them to \nforsake their wives.

Verily, Allah is the One Who \naccepts repentance, Most Merciful.\u201d [9:118] \n\n\nAllah\u2019s turning to them was a great joy for both Muslims and the three \nconcerned.

It was \n\n\n- 433 - \n\n\n\nquite obvious to everybody that no power but Islam\u2019s would live long \namong the Arabs. The remainders of Jahiliyin and hypocrites \u2014 who used \nto conspire steadily against the Muslims and who peipetually relied on \nByzantine power when they were in need of support or help \u2014 these people \nlost their expectations and desires of ever reclaiming their ex-influence. \nRealizing that there was no way out and that they were to submit to the fait \naccompli, they gave up their attempts. \n\nFrom that time on, hypocrites were no longer treated leniently or even \ngently by the Muslims. Allah not only bade Muslims to treat them severely \nbut He also forbade them to take their gift charities or perform prayer on \ntheir dead, or ask Allah\u2019s forgiveness for them or even visit their tombs. \nAllah bade the Muslims to demolish the mosque, which they verily \nappointed and used as a hiding place where they might practise their plots, \nconspiracy and deceit. Some Qur\u2019anic verses were sent down disclosing \nthem publicly and utterly so that everybody in Madinah got to know their \nreality. \n\nThe great impact that this invasion produced could be perceived in of the \ngreat number of delegations who came successively to meet the Messenger \nof All&h ^ <111 Naturally, deputations used to come to meet him at the \n\nend of an invasion particularly after Makkah Conquest! 1 ) but they were not \nas many as these nor were they as frequent as they were then in the wake of \nTabuk event. It was certainly the greatest. \n\nThe Qur\u2019anic Verses Relating to this Invasion: \n\nMany a verse of Bara \u2018a ( Tauba ) Chapter handling the event of Tabuk \nwere revealed.

They \n\nwere: \n\n1. After the Messenger\u2019s return from Tabuk, the sworn allegation of \ninfidelity! 1 ! between \u2018Uwaimir Al-\u2018Ajlani and his wife took place. \n\n2. Pelting with stones the Ghamidiyah woman who confessed committing \nadultery. She was pelted with stones only after weaning her child off her \nbreast milk. \n\n3. Negus Ashama; the king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), died so the Prophet \n\nfL., 4 i\u00bb performed prayer in absentia for him. \n\n4. The death of Umm Kulthum, the daughter of the Prophet , \u00ab*u ^l., the \n\nProphet felt extremely sad at her death. \u201cHad I got a third daughter, I \nwould let you marry her.\u201d He said to \u2018Uthman. \n\n5. The death of \u2018Abdullah bin Abi Salool, the head of hypocrites, after the \nProphet\u2019s return from Tabuk. The Messenger of Allah , 1 ,, \u00ab*u \u00abui ^ asked \nAllah\u2019s forgiveness for him. He also prayed for him in spite of \u2018Umar\u2019s \ndisapproval and his attempt to prevent him from doing that. Later on a \nQur\u2019anic verse was revealed attesting to \u2018Umar\u2019s right viewpoint. \n\n\n(riln cases of an infidelity accusation that lacks evidence, both husband and wife swear by \nAllah that they are innocent and did not commit infidelity. The husband invokes Allah'; \ncurses on himself if he is lying and the woman invokes Allah's wrath on her if she is \nlying. \n\n\n- 435 - \n\n\n\n\nAbu Bakr \n\nperforms the Pilgrimage \n\nIn the month Dhul-Qa\u2018dah or in Dhul-Hijjah of the very year (the ninth \nof Al-Hijra), the Messenger of Allah ^ dispatched Abu Bakr ^ <iii ^ \n\nthe truthful, as a deputy prince of Al-Hajj (pilgrimage), so that he would \nlead the Muslims in performing of the p il g rima ge rituals. \n\nSoon after the departure of the Muslims, there came a Revelation from \nAllSh: the opening passages of the Chapter 9 entitled \u2018Repentance\u2019 (Surah \nTauba or Bara\u2019a) in which \u2018freedom from obligation\u2019is proclaimed from \nAllah in regard to those idolatrous tribes who had shown no respect for the \ntreaties which they had entered into with the Prophet *_ui \n\nCommunication of this news went in line with the Arabian traditions of \nmaking public any change relating to declining conventions of blood and \nfortunes. \n\n\u2018Ali bin Abi Talib was deputed to make this declaration. He overtook \nAbu Bakr at Al-\u2018Aij or Dajnan. Abu Bakr inquired whether the Prophet \nfi\u2014 j had put him in command or he had just been commissioned to \n\nmake the announcement. \u201cI have been deputed to make the proclamation \nonly\u201d replied \u2018Ali. The two Companions then proceeded with the pilgrimage \nprocess. Towards the close of the rituals, on the day of the ritual sacrifice, \n\u2018Ali stood at Al-Jamrah (a spot at which stones are pelted) and read aloud to \nthe multitudes that thronged around him and declared quittance from \ncovenants with idolaters and giving them four months\u2019 respite to reconsider \ntheir position. As for the other idolaters with whom the believers had a \ntreaty and had abated nothing of the Muslims\u2019 rights nor had supported \nanyone against them, then the terms of the treaty would run valid until the \nduration of which expired. \n\nAbu Bakr then sent some Muslims to declare publicly that no disbeliever \nwould after that year perform pilgrimage, nor would anyone be allowed to \nmake the Tawaf (going round) of the Sacred House unclothed. \n\nThat proclamation in fact vetoed all aspects of paganism out of Arabia \nand stated quite unequivocally that those pre-Islam practices were no longer \nin operation.! 1 )", "start_char_idx": 859349, "end_char_idx": 863043, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e910102b-f708-4d0e-b078-0cbe64a63731": {"__data__": {"id_": "e910102b-f708-4d0e-b078-0cbe64a63731", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddc38f04-c3dc-48a8-a0c1-47b9516a1074", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "3ac9889c1afd495245547a4904997f2f83ee9bff0e88cb2b396415e0a3fc1abb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f44e145-a86d-427b-8763-f97fc1158f21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb601d2b00a9dba95194b4c8e3ce700386d759effda7419f78f316cbce9b7b91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "61f248eb5d8c02f727a4a9c679ef86c7cbe4f062ee7c1f5b7bea6e640b6ceafd", "text": "1,1 Sahih Al-Bukhari, 1/220,415,2/626,671; Zld Al-Ma'ad, 3/25,26; \nIbn Hisham, 2/543-546. \n\n\n- 436 - \n\n\n\nA Meditation on the Ghazawat \n\nMeditation on the Prophet\u2019s Ghazawat, missions, and the battalions he \nformed and dispatched, will certainly give us and everybody a true and clear \nimpression that the Prophet ^ <111 jl, was the greatest military leader in \n\nthe whole world as well as the most righteous, the most insightful and the \nmost alert one. He was not a man of superior genius for this concern but he \nwas also the Master and the greatest of all Messengers as far as Prophethood \nand Heavenly Message are concerned. Besides, all the battles that he had \nfought were standard in their application to the requirements of strictness, \nbravery, and good arrangements that fitted the terms and conditions of war. \nNone of the battles he fought was lost as a consequence of shortage of \nwisdom or due to any other technical error in army mobilization or a \nlocation in a wrong strategical position. The loss of any of his battle was not \ndue to misjudgement about occupying the best and the most appropriate \nsites of battles, nor was it due to a mischoice of leaders of the fight, for he \nhad proved himself to be a peculiar sort of leader that differs from any of \nthose leaders that our world had known and experienced. As regards Uhud \nand Hunain events, there were consequences of weakness in some military \nelements in Hunain; and disobedience to orders in Uhud. Their non- \ncompliance with wisdom and the plan of the battle played a passive role in \nthe course of those two invasions. \n\nHis genius was clearly shown in these two battles when the Muslims \nwere defeated; for he stoodfast facing the enemy and managed, by his super \nwisdom, to thwart the enemy\u2019s aim as was the case in Uhud. Similarly he \nmanaged to change the Muslims\u2019 defeat in Hunain into a victory. \nNotwithstanding the fact that serious grave developments in military \noperations usually leave the worst impression on the military leaders and \nentice them to flee for their lives. \n\nWe have, so far, discussed the mere aspects of military leadership of the \ninvasions. On the other hand, through these invasions he was able to impose \nsecurity, institute peace, diffuse dissension and destroy the military might of \nthe enemies through relentless struggle between Islam and paganism. \n\nThe Prophet had also profound insight and could differentiate the faithful \nfrom the hypocrites and plotters. \n\n\n- 437 - \n\n\n\nGreat was the group of military leaders who fought and excelled the \nPersians and the Byzantines in the battlefields of Ash-Sham and Iraq with \nrespect to war strategy and leading the fight procedures.

They were imbued with the spirit of Islam at the hand of the \nProphet fL. j <<u 4tu j*. \n\n\nThanks to these battles, the Messenger of Allah ^ \u00abui managed \naccommodation, seciued land and provided chances of work for all \nMuslims. He, even, made a lot of inquiries about the refugee problems who \n(then) had no houses or fortunes. He equipped the army with weapons, \nhorses and expenditures. He had all that realized without exercising a \nparticle weight of injustice. The Prophet ^ \u00ab*u \u00abui has altered the standards \nand aims of pre-Islamic wars. Their war was no more than robbing, killing, \nplundering, tyranny and aggression-oriented wars. Those wars focused on \nwinning victory, oppressing the weakling and demolishing their houses and \nconstructions. For them, war was a means by which they can rape or unveil \nwomen, practise cruelty against the weakling, the babies and small children, \nspoil tillage and race, and spread corruption on the earth. Islamic wars are \ndifferent from pre-Islamic wars. A \u201cwar\u201d in Islam is a Jihad. That is to say it \nis a noble sacred fight in the way of Allah for the verification of a Muslim \nsociety that seeks to free man from oppression, tyranny and aggression. It is \na society that everyone everywhere and at all times should be proud ofiPre- \nIslamic thoughts and traditions of Al-Jahiliyah period have been turned \nupside down by Islam. These were so hard upon the weakling that they had \nto invoke Allah to enable them to get away from that pre-Islamic \nenvironment by saying: \n\n\n. Ja U fJUaJI ijyijl \u00abJL\u00bb {jA iLj-l2j\u00bb \n\n{jA U \n\n\n\u201cOur Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are \noppressors, and raise for us from You one who will protect, and \nraise for us from You one who will help.\u201d \n\n\n- 438 - \n\n\n\nThe war of corruption, slaying and robbing that used to prevail has now \nturned into a sacred one, Al-Jihad. One of the greatest aims of Al-Jihad is to \nfree man from the aggression, the oppression and the tyranny of men of \npower. A man of power, in Islam, is a weakling till after the right of the \npoor is taken from him. War, in Islam, is & Jihad for the purification of the \nland of Allah from deception, treachery, sinful deeds and aggression. It is a \nsacred war that aims at spreading security, safety, mercy and compassion as \nwell as observing the rights and magnanimity. The Messenger of Allah \n(j\u2014j 4*u \u00abjii ^ had issued honourable strict rules about war and bade his \nsoldiers and leaders to comply with them. They were forbidden to break \nthose rules under any circumstances. In reference to Sulaiman bin \nBuraidah\u2019s version, who said that his father had told him that whenever the \nMessenger of Allah \u00ab*u un ^ appointed a leader on an army or on a \nbattalion, he used to recommend him to fear Allah, the Great and All- \nMighty, when dealing with those who were closest to him and to be good \nwith all Muslims.

The Arabs as \na result of that battle were able to differentiate the truth from the error. \nDelusion no longer existed in their life. So they raced to embrace Islam. \n\u2018Amr bin Salamah said: \u201cWe were at a water (spring) where the passage \nof people was. So when camel riders passed by us we used to ask them: \n\u2018What is the matter with people? What is this man (i.e. the Prophet) like?\u2019 \nThey would say, \u2018He claims that AMh has revealed so and so.\u2019 I used to \nmemorize those words as if they had been recited within my chest. The \nArabs used to ascribe their Islamization to the conquest. They would say: \n\u2018Leave him alone to face his people. If he were a truthful Prophet he \nwould overcome them.\u2019 So when the conquest took place, peoples \nhastened to declare their Islam. My father was the quickest of all my \npeople to embrace Islam. Arriving at his people he said: \u2018By Allah I have \njust verily been to the Prophet ^ju. And he said: \u2018Perform so a \nprayer at such a time, and so and so prayers at such and such time. When \nthe prayer time is due let one of you call for the prayer and appoint the \nmost learned of the Qur\u2019an among you to be an Imam (leader) of \nyours.!'!\u201d This Prophetic tradition manifests the great effect of the \nconquest of Makkah on the phase of events. It certainly shows the \ninfluence of the conquest of Makkah upon the consolidation of Islam as \nwell as on the Arabs\u2019 stand and their surrender to Islam. That influence \nwas absolutely confirmed and deeply rooted after the invasion of Tabuk. \nA clear and an obvious evidence of that influence could be deduced from \nthe great number of delegations arriving in Madinah successively in the \nninth and tenth years of Al-Hijra. The immense crowds of people who \nraced to embrace the religion of Allah and the great army which included \nten thousand fighters in the invasion of the conquest of Makkah had \ngrown big enough to include thirty thousand fighters sharing in Tabuk \n\n\nCl Sahih Al-Bukhari, 2/615,616.", "start_char_idx": 868986, "end_char_idx": 872796, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "921a4e36-0798-446e-b95f-39da3d7c6524": {"__data__": {"id_": "921a4e36-0798-446e-b95f-39da3d7c6524", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc7216ce-04db-43c5-ae52-fbc65dc9f130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "156dea33d42e8f454f6164452a4404379e60b5433b287c9cd267a6ba30cfed34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5187c8e-6c09-48db-9932-53b650cee1f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_name": "The Sealed Nectar Dataset(Textual).txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1029559, "creation_date": "2023-12-07", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-07", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-07"}, "hash": "06e5e19ddfbf205d8c299d5dea43ec0b3280f6e940059bbcfe73d51968964819", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8689b9ef-11d5-4ebb-ac38-fef429510bb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fdcd4ed94264b8f354a9cba8be9642dd54538738a113390434b4c4c9931ebf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "077ca8d577c783e0acf8252fb7c467869bbbf35ea699eeed83c6836503c766a4", "text": "Cl Sahih Al-Bukhari, 2/615,616. \n\n\n\ninvasion.

Sudd\u2019 was (a fresh-water fountain) \nin Yemen. While the mission was camping there at the starting point of a \ncanal.

Arriving in Madinah, he stayed at a man\u2019s \nhouse from Juhainah as a guest. They performed the dawn prayer \ntogether; but when he was about to leave, the man suggested that he go to \nthe Messenger of Allah ^ \u00ab*i\u00bb un j*. He went there, sat by him, put his \nhand in his. The Messenger of Allah ^ ^ who had never seen Ka\u2018b \n\nbefore, did not recognize him.

He acknowledged Muhammad\u2019s mission. Both Emigrants and \nHelpers were spoken of in this poem but differently. He praised the \nEmigrants but criticized the Helpers, for one of them demanded a \nProphet\u2019s permission to kill him. Later on Ka\u2018b tried to compensate for \nthat by praising the Helpers too but that was in another poem. \n\n6. \u2018Udharah Delegation: This delegation which consisted of twelve men, \nhad arrived in Madinah in Safar, the ninth year of Al-Hijra. They spent \nthree days there. One of them was Hamza bin An-Nu\u2018man. When they \nwere asked who they were, they said \u201cWe are Bani \u2018Udharah, the foster \nbrothers of Qusai to his mother. We are the ones who supported Qusai, \nand removed Khuza\u2019a and Bani Bakr from the bosom of Makkah.

Eventually \nthey became Muslims, stayed there for several days then went back. \n\n\n7. Bali Delegation: Their arrival was in Rabi\u2018 Al-Awwal, the ninth year of \nAl-Hijra. They embraced Islam, stayed in Madinah for three days. Their \nchief Abu Ad-Dabeeb wondered whether hospitality was rewarded by \nAllah.

The Arabs observed Al-Madinah \nwith such a great respect and estimation that they could do nothing but \nsurrender and submit to it. Al-Madinah had become the headquarters of all \nArabia; so it was impossible to avoid it. We dare not say that all the \nArabians were possessed and enchanted by this religion. There were lots of \nhard-hearted bedouins \u2014 among the Arabs \u2014 who surrendered (i.e. became \nMuslims) only because their master did so. Their souls were not sanctified \nyet. Their tendency to raids had been deeply rooted in their souls. The \nteachings of Islam had not crystallized their souls well yet.

And Allah is All-Hearer, \nAll-Knower[9:97,98] \n\n\nThe Qur\u2019an praised others saying: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd of the bedouins there are some who believe in Allah and \nthe Last Day, and look upon what they spend in Allah\u2019s cause as \napproaches to Allah, and a cause of receiving the Messenger\u2019s \ninvocations.

Satan, who was its leader did not spare a moment \nwithout exercising his activity in the depth of human conscience. \nMuhammad jL., on the other hand was attending on calling to \n\nAllah\u2019s religion there and he was keen on fighting that perpetual battle in all \nfields in spite of their hard circumstances and the world\u2019s conspiracy against \nhim. He went on calling effectively and actively surrounded by the believers \nwho were seeking security through ceaseless toil and great patience. \n\nThe Companions acted perpetually and patiently by day and they spent \nthe night worshipping their Lord, reciting and memorizing the Qur\u2019an \nglorifying and magnifying Allah and imploring Him by night; all that at the \nbehest of their Lord, the All-Mighty.!*! \n\nFor over twenty years the Messenger of Allah had been \n\nleading that progressive steady battle, disregarding any other affairs that \nkept him off that noble goal. He went on {hat way till the Islamic Call \nproved to be successful on a large scale that puzzled all men possessed of \ngood reason. \n\nThe Islamic Call eventually prevailed all over Arabia. It removed all \ntraces of Al-Jahiliyah from the horizon of the peninsula. The sick minds of \nAl-Jahiliyah grew healthy in Islam. They did not only get rid of idol- \nworship, but they also knocked them down. The general atmosphere began \nto echo \u201cthere is no god but Allah.\u201d The calls to prayers were heard five \ntimes a day penetrating space and breaking the silence of the dead desert \nand bringing back life through the new belief. Reciters and memorizers of \nthe Qur\u2019an set out northwards and southwards reciting verses of the Qur\u2019an \nand carrying out Allah\u2019s injunctions. \n\nScattered people and tribes were united and man moved from man\u2019s \nworship of man to man\u2019s worship of Allah. There were no more oppressors \nnor oppressed; no masters nor slaves, nor people bound to other people, nor \naggressors that would practise aggression. All people were slaves of Allah. \nThey were beloved brothers obeying Allah\u2019s rules.

These marriages were in fact motivated by \naims and purposes much more glorious and greater than what nor mal \nmarriages usually aim at. \n\nThe tendency of the Messenger of Allah ^ 411 j* towards es tablishing \na relationship by marriage with both Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar and his marriage \nto \u2018 Aishah and Hafsah \u2014 and getting his daughter Fatimah married to \u2018 Ali \nbin Abi Talib, and the marriage of his two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm \nKulthum to \u2018Uthman \u2014 indicate clearly that he aimed at confirmin g the \nrelationship among the four men \u2014 whose sacrifices and great \nachievements in the cause of Islam are well-known. \n\nBesides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law \nrelations. For them a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they \nsought the consolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. \nHostility and fights against alliances and affinities would bring an \nunforgettable shame, disgrace and degradation to them. \n\nBy marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet fa wanted to \n\ndemolish or break down the Arab tribes\u2019 enmity to Islam and extinguish \ntheir intense hatred.

He had to teach them to comply with the necessities of civilization \nand to contribute to the solidification and the establishment of a new Islamic \nsociety. \n\nAn essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing \nof men and women. Providing direct education for women, though highly \ncompelling, is impossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the \nProphet ft-, \u00abui had to select some women of different ages and talents, \nand indoctrinate them systematically in order to educate she-bedouins and \ntownswomen, old and young, and thus furnish them with the instruments of \npropagating the true faith. The Mothers of believers (i.e. wives of the \nProphet ,ju, <jii jj-) were in such a convenient position that they could \nconvey the state of the Prophet ^ \u00abui and his affairs to people (men and \nwomen). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of Islam, his \nwives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in \nconveying Prophetic traditions Ahadith to the Muslims. \u2018Aishah, for \ninstance, related a large number of the Prophet\u2019s deeds and statements. \n\nHis marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case \nwhich aimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition \u2014 i.e. the \nadoption of children. In Al-Jahiliyah the Arabs used to consider an adopted \nperson exactly like a real son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are \nconcerned. That Jahiliyah tradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts \nthat it was not easy to remove or uproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the \nbasic principles of Islam; especially those concerned with marriage, divorce \nand inheritance and some other cases, and brought about lots of corruptions \nand indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against such deeds, and attempts to \nremove them from the Islamic society. \n\nFor the eradication of this tradition, Allah, die Exalted, bid His \nMessenger to marry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an \n\nex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance with Zaid to an extent that he intended \nto divorce her \u2014 that was at die time when the Confederates ( Al-Ahzab ) \nwere making an evil alliance against the Messenger of Allah ^ v* \u00abi\u00bb and \nagainst the Muslims. The Messenger of Allah \u00abw ^ feared that the \nhypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it \n\n\n- 487 - \n\n\n\nand try to influence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged \nZaid not to divorce her, in order not to get involved into that trial. \n\n\nUndoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of \nthe Prophet ^ *jii . They did not apply to the power of determination \nand will with which he had been sent. Allah, the Exalted, blamed him for \nthat by saying: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha \n\u00abjji \u2014 the freed slave of the Prophet , ju , ^ 411 jJ) on whom \nAllah has bestowed grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O \nMuhammad ^ an too) have done favour (by manumitting \nhim), \u2018Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah.\u2019 But you did \nhide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you \nthat He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will \nmake manifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad \nji.., \u00ab*i\u00bb <jji jU married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) \nwhereas Allah had a better right that you should fear him.\u201d \n[33:37] \n\n\nFinally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allah ^ <*u \u00abw ju \nmarried her at the time he laid siege to Bani Quraiza.
